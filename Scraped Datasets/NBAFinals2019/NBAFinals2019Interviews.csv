1,2019-06-13,"Fred VanVleet","Postgame","Toronto Win","FRED VANVLEET: If that's what you want, man, write whatever story you want.  I don't even give a damn.  Just unbelievably blessed.  Obviously I take family very seriously and hold it dear to my heart, so it came at a great time.  And there's a lot of other things that go into that.  I won't bore you with the details, but that's the story you like so be it","Player"
2,2019-06-13,"Fred VanVleet","Postgame","Toronto Win","FRED VANVLEET: It's all of those things.  You nailed it.  There's no one thing.  We have a lot of talent, we're very deep team.  You go down this roster, there were guys who didn't even play who are very capable.  We have a lot of talent.  When that talent works hard and goes out there and pays it forward every day, then have you a chance to be special.  And then when you're tied in and your coaching staff gives you good game plans, and you go out there and try to execute, and you work together, the sky's the limit.  And we were able to do that over the course of the playoffs","Player"
3,2019-06-13,"Fred VanVleet","Postgame","Toronto Win","FRED VANVLEET: We're NBA champions so if that makes you a super team I'll take it.  People don't view us that way because it's untraditional.  It's not the glam stars.  None of our guys probably, other than Kawhi, are in that big boy club or the fan boy club of the NBA.  We got guys who had to get it the long way, who had to get it out of the mud, who had to get it against the grain.  And we got a team full of them coming from all different places, all walks of life, all different life stories to get to this moment.  But we got some talent, we got some talent for sure.  And at the end of the day going out there in the playoffs is about performing at a high level, and we were able to do that over the course of two months","Player"
4,2019-06-13,"Fred VanVleet","Postgame","Toronto Win","FRED VANVLEET: I think it allows you to lock in a little bit better.  I think it allows you to have that us against the world mentality where the only thing that matters is the guy next to you.  And your crowd being anxious and excited doesn't have any affect on you when you're on the road.  It takes a different level of effort, and I think that for us going on the road it allowed us to take it up a notch more than what we usually do.  You can't rely on the crowd to give you runs or to give you energy, you got to go out there and do it yourself.  Usually winning a NBA championship you're going to have to win some games on the road and we were able to do that","Player"
5,2019-06-13,"Fred VanVleet","Postgame","Toronto Win","FRED VANVLEET: Yeah.  Just try to pay our respects and shake most of those guys' hands as best you can.  He was kind of the first guy I was next to.  Just obviously letting him know how much respect and admiration I have for him and vice versa.  We compete, we really compete together, we compete on this stage.  And those guys are super competitors, as are we.  So to be able to just in defeat, their guys are very gracious, and they know what it takes to get to this stage, so they were very congratulatory as well","Player"
6,2019-06-13,"Fred VanVleet","Postgame","Toronto Win","FRED VANVLEET: Yeah.  I just tried to own up to it.  I tried to live up to it.  It's a big task, it's a big assignment, and I know what it meant to our team.  So I did pretty good over the course of the series.  He got loose, it felt like he scored a thousand points on me.  As a defender you never like getting scored on, so that was tough.  And it's obviously the toughest guy I had to guard for that long every game, all game, a million screens, it's hard to push and grab, he's so good at drawing fouls.  So I just tried to live up to the challenge and accept the challenge and hopefully I gained some respect there and just tried to help my team get wins","Player"
7,2019-06-13,"Fred VanVleet","Postgame","Toronto Win","FRED VANVLEET: He's our head coach.  He's our head coach.  And you guys kill head coaches when we lose.  Coaches get all the blame, and when we win players get all the credit, so that's just how it goes.  But Nick has been unbelievable.  He's kind of been the captain of the ship, and he's weathered the storms, and he's kept us even-keeled, and he's made some unusual adjustments and experimented things.  And some things worked and some things didn't, but he was trying.  He tried everything and you got to give that guy a lot of credit in his first year to win a NBA championship.  Also want to give Coach Casey a lot of credit for building this team up to what it was, the guys who were here before, DeMar, JV, Delon, Jakob, the guys who we built this up to what it was, and then to be able to take it to the next level this year, give Nurse a lot of credit for steering that ship.  Don't ask no damn question back there","Player"
8,2019-06-13,"Fred VanVleet","Postgame","Toronto Win","FRED VANVLEET: Um, it's unbelievable, man.  It's unbelievable to have guys like Kyle Lowry on your team who step up and go for 15 in the first quarter.  But he should have had 50.  But he slowed down, so I just wanted to come out there in the second half and bail him out and just try to help him for his legacy.  They killed my man all the time in the playoffs.  He gets more slandered than anybody I ever seen in the league.  And so to have him be able to hold that trophy up tonight, that's what means the most for us","Player"
9,2019-06-13,"Pascal Siakam","Postgame","Unknown","PASCAL SIAKAM: I think that it meant a lot, just having guys from different countries and speaking different languages. I think it kind of got us closer together. And you kind of have all those little kind of friendship with guys that you can speak the same language with, and from Spanish to French to English, different cultures. And I think kind of it represents Toronto in general, having that diversity","Player"
10,2019-06-13,"Pascal Siakam","Postgame","Unknown","PASCAL SIAKAM: Yeah, hopefully I can take it in a little bit minute by minute. The champagne makes it hard. But it's amazing, it's amazing, just excited, happy, kind of like seeing -- it's hard to just sit down and think about everything. But just the hard work and everything you put in, to be able to be here at this level and be able to win, it's a dream, it's a dream. And it feels amazing to be able to realize your dreams","Player"
11,2019-06-13,"Pascal Siakam","Postgame","Unknown","PASCAL SIAKAM: I think we have, as a team, obviously, we have the best player in the league and the best player in these playoffs in Kawhi Leonard. But I think together we have this unit, a bunch of guys that will go out there and, they weren't top picks or whatever the case might be. But guys that just go out there and work every single day and try to be the best that they can be and unselfish. And it didn't matter in the beginning of the season, Marc starting or Serge starting, and we had that change. And every single time everyone sacrificing everything for the team and the greater good. I think that's what makes us so special, just that we are a team and that's what makes us dangerous","Player"
12,2019-06-13,"Pascal Siakam","Postgame","Unknown","PASCAL SIAKAM: I think credit to him, just using the pieces that he had and kind of seeing me being able to do different things on the floor and kind of exploring that and giving me a chance to go out there. Not only me, but giving the confidence to guys like Fred and Norm and everyone, kind of feeling like it's an equal opportunity type of team. Obviously knowing who our best player is, but just continuing to trust each other and having that mindset that at any time anyone can go off. And he kind of gave us that freedom. So that's credit to him and he's been able to do a good job of that","Player"
13,2019-06-13,"Pascal Siakam","Postgame","Unknown","PASCAL SIAKAM: For me it's a lot of ups and down, man. And I think that's what makes the journey so exciting, just because you know you're not at your best, like you're not the best that you can be. I think for me as a player, young player, just going out there every single day knowing that, I'm knowing here where like how good I can be. And it kind I have gives me the opportunity to go out there and learn every single day, make mistakes and have bad games, but just continue to trust my work and everything that I put in to be here at this level, knowing that I deserve to be here at this level, and kind of like working every single day to be the best player that I can be. I'm going to have bad games, I'm going to miss shots, a lot of them. But at the same time, I just have to have the confidence to go out there and be myself and play the game that I love. And I think everything will always be okay when I do that","Player"
14,2019-06-13,"Pascal Siakam","Postgame","Unknown","PASCAL SIAKAM: Oh, man, I think it means a lot. I think that's one of the reasons why I'm here and I have this flag representing Cameroon and Africa. I think for me as a kid I didn't have the opportunity to dream about this moment. I didn't think I could make it. I didn't think this was possible as a kid. And I think a lot of kids don't think that it's possible. Just me being able to be here today and telling them that, hey, look at me, I was a little scrawny kid from Cameroon and just had -- I couldn't even think about this moment. But here I'm at as a champion. And I just want to tell them that it's possible and that if you believe in something, go out there and work hard for it. It might sound clich√©, but it's the truth. I'm the proof.","Player"
15,2019-06-13,"Nick Nurse","Postgame","Toronto Win","NICK NURSE: Yeah.  It was a heck of a 12 months.  And I don't know, I just try to take things as they come.  Didn't look too far ahead.  Obviously when we made some a additions to the team, we thought we could be good, but we had no idea what the health status was and all those things.  Again, you just got to go take the guys you got and go play and manage it the best you can.  And then look at the opponents and try to figure out a way to beat them.  It was a great group, though.  They really played together.  I thought they really fought hard, they were tough-minded.  They didn't seem like this was wearing on them at all.  Two months of playoff basketball, they never seemed tired to me.  Mentally they kept wanting film sessions, they kept wanting to walk through things, they kept wanting to keep learning and improving.  And I think that was a big key because we had to do that in the playoff run because we really hadn't had all that much time together","Coach"
16,2019-06-13,"Nick Nurse","Postgame","Toronto Win","NICK NURSE: Well, first of all, you're right.  I think that you thought, get through the East and the chances were you were going to be playing Golden State.  I mean, I probably stayed up late and watched Golden State more than anybody just for the heck of it.  Just to see what they were doing and all that kind of stuff.  I don't know, it means a lot for our city and the country and for these players, staff.  An incredible group of people, my assistant coaches and the support staff.  And I don't know if it would have meant any more or any less, to be honest with you.  You get the win and you're just happy you got it and celebrate that fact","Coach"
17,2019-06-13,"Nick Nurse","Postgame","Toronto Win","NICK NURSE: A hundred percent.  That was hard on them.  I think they had a rough year injury-wise, and they kept playing.  They got through some playoff rounds and guys in and out.  And obviously a lot of things, a lot of bad breaks in The Finals, to be honest.  Like us, they kept on playing.  We just had to keep on playing no matter who was out there.  And I think they were super intense high level games and both teams desperately trying to win.  I have a tremendous amount of respect for Coach Kerr and his staff and their players, for sure","Coach"
18,2019-06-13,"Nick Nurse","Postgame","Toronto Win","NICK NURSE: Well, I would hope it inspires some people that are in those situations to keep working.  I always say that all those jobs meant the world to me at the time, right, winning with Birmingham in '96, winning with Rio Grande Valley, whatever year that was.  And those games and jobs meant the world to me and I loved all those jobs.  I think you can't do very good work if you don't love what you're doing.  I just, I don't know, and I never really got discouraged.  I didn't really care at the level I was coaching at, I was just trying to learn and get better.  That's it.","Coach"
19,2019-06-13,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: Yeah, it's great working for him.  He's set the goals very high for our organization, similar to what the goals that our staff and our players set, so that's good to be in alignment with where we're thinking, where we want to go.  And you're right, he's put together a heck of a roster and some great players and the blend is really good.  So I've enjoyed working with him this year","Coach"
20,2019-06-13,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: Great question.  I mean it is something you bat back and forth a little bit because you think, here's another coverage we could use or another matchup or we could flip in and out of this coverages or whatever defense we decide to play.  Or you just say, gosh, if we just would run down a few more 50/50 balls or shoot a little bit better from three or take care of the ball, you know, some tangible intangibles, do those just a little bit better then you're probably good.  Then you sit and you look and say, geez, you only scored 106 points and you lost the game.  106 against these guys is pretty good, you should think you got to score 107 or more, right?  So it's a really good question and you battle it back and forth of do you just kind of stick with what you've been doing and try to do it a little bit better, or do you try to break out a couple new things this late in a series.  I'm still debating on that","Coach"
21,2019-06-13,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: Yeah.  I just, it seems like we haven't talked about it as much.  You're right, in the Milwaukee series I remember saying that about every other meeting like this that we had.  It is still critical because, again, the transition against these guys is so hard, right.  You're really racing back.  If you turn it over you're in trouble.  They're coming fast and usually dotting you with a three ball.  If you don't score in stretches, they're playing with it off the rim on long rebounds or whatever and again they're coming hard.  And everybody's seen when Green gets one, he's going to push it and it's going to be super fast pace.  And they got some guys that can shoot it on the kickout.  So it really is critical for us to, A, take care of it, and B, score it fairly consistently so we can make them take it out of the net some","Coach"
22,2019-06-13,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: Yeah.  I mean, and again, I think we have taken care of it pretty well.  You always want to cut down on the turnovers no matter what number you end up with.  But pretty good, right?  We have generated a lot of shots at the rim, we have got to the free-throw line, we have got, from what I consider for the most part, pretty good looks from behind the three-point line.  We have got to shoot them a little bit better than we did in the last game for sure","Coach"
23,2019-06-13,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: I'm not worried about that at all, right.  I think he's proven all playoffs long that, and even all season long, that he's a prime time player.  The other night I just if you want me to be totally candid, I wasn't happy with his defensive effort.  I thought he just could have done more.  He could have been more active, he could have got down in his stance earlier and more often, and just been more of a problem at that end.  And that's why he wasn't in there at the end","Coach"
24,2019-06-13,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: Thanks for bringing that night up.  Appreciate that.  We got our doors blown off down there.  I haven't thought about that night much, but I do, the playoff games, we have had some up and down moments as everybody has.  This team we're playing tonight has had some really up and down moments in the playoffs.  That's the nature of this.  I think if I'm close to correct, our last regular season game was two months ago.  So two months of basketball's going to be some ups and downs in it.  I just, after that San Antonio loss, we got on a plane and went to Milwaukee and beat them.  We bounced right back.  And that's what we normally do.  That's what we have normally done in the playoffs.  And this is a strong minded, tough-ass group of guys.  It really is.  And I'm looking forward to watching them play tonight","Coach"
25,2019-06-13,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: Yeah.  I mean I just, you come in there after a loss, and the importance everybody places on home court, and you really had a chance to grab ahold of the series and all of a sudden you're even.  Like they have considered it a huge triumph to come and get one of the two.  They're 1-1 and got the momentum of the series.  And just so it doesn't seem as disastrous as it may appear on the outside, you just try to calm down and say, hey, we just got to get one.  We got to get one, that's all we got to do.  We know we can do that.  That's it.  I'm not trying to, I don't say a whole lot after games.  And some of it we just say it to wrap it up and then get on with it and we start looking at the film and really digging in the next day","Coach"
26,2019-06-13,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: Well, it's not really my area or putting together the team or my thought process.  My job is to take the team Masai and Bobby put together and get those guys to max out what they can do, get them to play together, get them to play tough defense, get them to share the ball and get them to handle adversity with some calmness and handle triumph with some calmness.  And then you got to look at who you're playing and you got to try to figure it out.  I was telling somebody today, I said you look at these things and you say, Jesus, I don't know how we're going to beat these guys.  And then you say God, there's got to be a way we can figure it out.  In two sentences you go from one end to the other and that's what the job is.  You got to respect how good the team is you're playing, because they are, how well coached they are, how tough it is to win these games.  And then you got to prepare your guys the best you can and then let them go at it.","Coach"
27,2019-06-13,"Kyle Lowry","Postgame","Toronto Win","KYLE LOWRY: When he made the trade as a friend of mine, my emotions was there, but I understood that I had to go to work, and I still played for the Toronto Raptors.  So I knew that that's my job, my job was to go out there and to be the best basketball player I could be.  How I feel now is we won the championship.  I mean it's a great feeling","Player"
28,2019-06-13,"Kyle Lowry","Postgame","Toronto Win","KYLE LOWRY: Words can't explain how I feel.  It's been a long, long time.  13 years of NBA basketball.  Couple years of college.  A couple years of high school basketball.  And to be able to say I'm a world champion, it makes me feel great.  And to do it with the group of guys that we did it with is amazing, like it's just kind of still surreal.  Kind of, it hasn't hit me yet.  I'm still kind of in this moment of just like is this real yet?  And for me just at the end of the day, I work extremely hard on my game, I work extremely hard on myself, and I am extremely hard on myself.  And I'm happy to be able to say I'm a champion and it's been a long time coming","Player"
29,2019-06-13,"Kyle Lowry","Postgame","Toronto Win","KYLE LOWRY: People got their own opinions.  They can say what they want to say.  They always have.  I hear them, I listen, but they don't affect my life.  Everyone has their own opinions.  And I go out there and I do my job to the best of my abilities.  And the people that know, my teammates, the organization, they know what I bring to the table, and they appreciate what I do and what I've done.  And I score zero points, people blah, blah, blah, I do this, I don't score.  I understand what people say, I hear them.  But if we win a game and we win as a group, then that's all that matters.  Winning is all that matters to me.  And I'm at the highest level winning right now","Player"
30,2019-06-13,"Kyle Lowry","Postgame","Toronto Win","KYLE LOWRY: I took what the game was going to give me, but I wanted to be aggressive.  I look back at every game we've played and that we've won I've shot double figure times.  And I was more aggressive.  The games, I think besides Game 1, but other games, all the other games we won, I was more aggressive offensively, makes or misses.  But people thought that we were kind of be like oh, man, we gave away Game 5.  But the group of guys that we have, we have been able to stay level-headed the whole time and understanding that we had a team that was going to come out here and play extremely hard, fans were going to be loud, and they were going to fight to the death.  That's the one thing about that group, they fought to the death.  And they got some great guys down there, great coaches, and we tip our hats to those guys because they, they're the definition of champions","Player"
31,2019-06-13,"Kyle Lowry","Postgame","Toronto Win","KYLE LOWRY: How tough, I mean it's a lot, he's unable believably good, he's been showing that all year.  There's nothing you can -- he's shown us this all year.  Yeah, he's a NBA Finals MVP again","Player"
32,2019-06-13,"Kyle Lowry","Postgame","Toronto Win","KYLE LOWRY: It's kind of crazy.  There's a lot of guys that has this same journey and they haven't been able to get to this point.  I'm just so happy to be able to be a part of it and to say I'm a NBA champion.  I don't take it for granted at all.  I know how hard it's been, how hard it is to get here.  I know how hard it takes and it takes some luck also.  And it takes some purified professionals just to go out there and keep going and working and trying to get it done.  I'm happy to be a part of that fraternity now to say I'm a champion","Player"
33,2019-06-13,"Kyle Lowry","Postgame","Toronto Win","KYLE LOWRY: No.  I always wanted to keep working, I love this game, I love this job, I love my life.  I just continue to grow, just continue to get better as a man, as a basketball player, as an individual","Player"
34,2019-06-13,"Kyle Lowry","Postgame","Toronto Win","KYLE LOWRY: I don't drink, so I didn't want to partake.  I did a couple sprays and I wanted to make sure that everybody, we all, I was in there a little bit.  And for this basketball, I'll make sure that we'll put that one in the practice gym or somewhere and have it done up to say 2019 NBA champions.  That one will be displayed somewhere in Toronto","Player"
35,2019-06-13,"Kyle Lowry","Postgame","Toronto Win","KYLE LOWRY: The city of Toronto, the country, the country of Canada, we did it, we brought it home and we want everybody to celebrate, celebrate safely","Player"
36,2019-06-13,"Kyle Lowry","Postgame","Toronto Win","KYLE LOWRY: When he texted me it was a quick text and just showed the type of person he is.  Willing to reach out, understanding that this situation was a little bit sensitive.  But he knew that he felt something could be done special with our group and I don't know nothing about the Drake curse.  That's my homey, that's my friend, so I don't know nothing about a curse.  Thank you.","Player"
37,2019-06-13,"Kawhi Leonard","Postgame","Toronto Win","KAWHI LEONARD: We all know where my destinations were.  But obviously like I said, when I was there on my opening day meeting that I was focused on the now, and I wanted to make history here and that's all did I.  I just, I'm still playing basketball no matter what jersey I have on.  And the guys here have been making runs in the playoffs before I came, so I know they were a talented team.  And I just came in with the right mindset, let's go out and win ball games.  I texted Kyle probably a day later -- or the day that I got traded and told him I said let's go out and do something special.  I know your best friend left, I know you're mad, but let's make this thing work out.  And we are here today","Player"
38,2019-06-13,"Kawhi Leonard","Postgame","Toronto Win","KAWHI LEONARD: Well, first, I'll start with Klay.  I hope he's okay.  I never want to see a good friend of mine go out like that.  I hope he's able to recover from it or it's nothing serious.  And when he went down I just really thought about him.  I didn't care about the game that much.  Once he left, you just, we got to flip our mindset back to trying to beat the Warriors.  So that's what I did.  With the shot with Steph, it didn't look like it was a good shot.  I mean he hits those shots, but I wasn't too worried about it at that moment.  Obviously he can make that.  He made it millions of times, but I just was focused on the rebound.  I've been in situations like that in a Finals that I lost by two or three points, and we lost that game because of rebounds.  I forgot who shot the ball, you guys know the story.  It was the last two possessions for Miami, they got two chances to shoot threes -- well, four chances at the basket out of two possessions.  And that was my fault because I was trying to get the rebound.  And once he missed the ball I tried to keep tipping it so some more time could run out.  Didn't want to grab it right away so they could foul me.  And Draymond ended up waiting with .9 seconds and called a timeout and kept moving from there","Player"
39,2019-06-13,"Kawhi Leonard","Postgame","Toronto Win","KAWHI LEONARD: Well, just the year, last year, a lot of people were doubting me.  They thought I was either faking an injury or didn't want to play for a team.  That was disappointing to go me that that was out in the media, because I love the game of basketball.  Like I always say, if we're not playing this game, if we're hurt, I mean you're down.  So me just going through that, and I just knew that I would have to make myself happy and no one else.  And I have to trust myself.  And whatever, it doesn't matter what anybody has to say about me.  I know who I am as a person, I know how I feel, and always just trust yourself.  And that was my goal and my focus.  And that's why one of the things that I take on the floor.  I don't care about what the media has to say about me or if they want me to score or whatever, 30 points, because I did the game before, I'm going to come out and play the right way, I'm not trying to make headlines.  And that's just things that I pretty much learned just throughout this journey of being in the NBA.  So that's how I just keep growing up as a man and that's why I say, I just think about my past life and try to learn from situations and be wise and learn from others","Player"
40,2019-06-13,"Kawhi Leonard","Postgame","Toronto Win","KAWHI LEONARD: It meant a lot.  Like I said, last summer was tough.  I was still rehabbing and just trusted the process, really, with myself.  I told myself I would be back.  I wasn't going to come back until I could be the player I am today.  I wanted to come back in the same shape and form without coming out playing five games and then re-injuring something.  I wanted to be able to play the season -- or what did I this year.  I wasn't able to play 82, but I'm happy that I got to the 60 games.  Just being able to win this championship this year is just something special for me because you know how the last year everybody was looking at me, and I stayed true to myself, and I had a great support system.  And once I got here to Toronto they understood everything and kept moving from there","Player"
41,2019-06-13,"Kawhi Leonard","Postgame","Toronto Win","KAWHI LEONARD: That was very special.  Obviously I didn't come out in this series trying to win it.  It was a whole group collectively.  Tonight Fred played amazing in that fourth.  Kyle played amazing tonight throughout the whole game.  Pascal played big.  I just kept striving and pushing and I ended up with the trophy but everybody deserves it.","Player"
42,2019-06-13,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Toronto Win","STEVE KERR: Yeah.  I mean more than the what ifs is just feeling bad for the players involved.  Injuries are always part of the NBA season -- any professional sport, injuries play a huge role.  It's just the nature of these injuries, the severity of these injuries.  And we'll know more about Klay.  But we can sit here and say, well, if this hadn't happened or that hadn't happened, that doesn't matter.  What matters is Kevin Durant is going to miss next season with an Achilles tear and Klay suffered a knee injury.  And we'll know, as I said, we'll know more before too long.  But it's just brutal.  It's just brutal of what these guys have had to deal with and what they're dealing with right now.  So that's my initial feeling","Coach"
43,2019-06-13,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Toronto Win","STEVE KERR: It's amazement that we're sitting in this position with, during the game we have a chance to win the game and force a Game 7 and go back to Toronto, and you just think, how?  How has this group of guys put themselves in position to do it.  And then as I said, when Klay goes down and is out for the game, it's just sort of a, you got to be kidding me, like this has to stop.  But it's just the way it's gone.  I don't know if it's related to five straight seasons of playing a hundred plus games and just all the wear and tear, but it's devastating","Coach"
44,2019-06-13,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Toronto Win","STEVE KERR: Well, I think what happened was he wasn't aware of the rule that if you don't shoot the free throws, you can't come back in the game.  So I think somebody told him in the hallway.  Klay being Klay he just turned right around and came back and shot the free throws.  And we committed the automatic foul to get him out of the game and he came back and he told me just two minutes.  I think there was just two minutes left in the third, and he said just a two minute rest, I'll be ready.  And next thing I heard was he was done for the night from Drew Yoder, our trainer","Coach"
45,2019-06-13,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Toronto Win","STEVE KERR: Doesn't matter.  He went down","Coach"
46,2019-06-13,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Toronto Win","STEVE KERR: Well, they're a gifted, competitive group.  And even without the injured players, even without Klay, even without KD you look out on the floor you still got a lot of great basketball players.  Andre had a huge night for us.  We had to have that.  Somebody had to come in and score for us tonight.  Andre did that.  Draymond was fighting like crazy all night.  Looney with a fractured chest cartilage, fighting and fighting and fighting.  I thought DeMarcus came in, gave us good minutes.  So we just kept going and I think our guys relied on their experience of being in this moment.  They don't get nervous.  I think they just keep playing and we had a chance.  So they fought and gave it every opportunity","Coach"
47,2019-06-13,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Toronto Win","STEVE KERR: I just thought it was in.  I always think every shot Steph takes is going in.  But they don't all go in.  But what a warrior, no punch intended.  Steph was getting hounded this entire series.  Toronto did a great job on him sending two, three people at him, hounding him and harassing him.  And especially without Klay to rely on in that fourth quarter, I thought he got a little worn down","Coach"
48,2019-06-13,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Toronto Win","STEVE KERR: I thought, I was really pleased with the way DeMarcus performed the last couple games.  He came in and gave us huge minutes and gave it everything he had, committed himself to the team and came off the bench and kept us going when we needed him.  So tough season for him in terms of coming off the injury.  And then getting injured again in the playoffs.  So it was not easy for him, but I think he contributed and I think he learned a lot and I think our guys really enjoyed being around him.  I know I did.  He helped us, he helped us win a lot of games.","Coach"
49,2019-06-13,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: Yeah.  I mean, it's still raw, obviously.  This has only been whatever it is, 48 hours, 72 hours, so I've texted, I've talked to some of the guys who have spoken with him.  Everybody's been reaching out to him and fortunately everything went well.  And so tonight we're thinking of him.  I know our fans are all thinking about him.","Coach"
50,2019-06-13,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: Kevon just warmed up on the court with Chris DeMarco and he's doing decently.  So I think he'll give it a go and we'll see how he holds up","Coach"
51,2019-06-13,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: Well, this is unique.  This is sort of a once-in-a-career moment where you play in a building for the very last time, and you absolutely know positively without a doubt that it's the last game you'll ever play here.  We had a ceremony at the end of the year in the regular season, but we knew we were coming back here to play.  And then we had that weird Game 4 a few days ago where we lost and it sure felt anti-climatic, like this can't be the last game at Oracle.  Now it's here and it's definite and it's in the midst of this series that we're trying to win, so there's a lot going on.","Coach"
52,2019-06-13,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: I think the benefit of our team having the experience that we do over the last five years, they seem to respond no matter what the circumstances are.  So I'm very confident that they will play and they will settle into the game and they will compete and find a way to get into a rhythm.  There's not a whole lot to say.  Everybody knows what's at stake and what's happening, so it's not like I have to give a big speech or anything.  But it's just let's get our work in, let's do our jobs and see what happens.","Coach"
53,2019-06-13,"Draymond Green","Postgame","Toronto Win","DRAYMOND GREEN: I mean I feel great to go to war with those guys every single night, through everything we went through this year.  You look at some of the stuff that's gone on and it's like, oh, that was two years ago, no that was like five months ago, it was seven months ago, two months ago.  Like everything this team has been through, I'm extremely proud of the guys, the way we fought.  It was great, but we lost.  There's no moral victories.  Congratulations to Toronto, they played a great series and they deserved to win","Player"
54,2019-06-13,"Draymond Green","Postgame","Toronto Win","DRAYMOND GREEN: Obviously you feel good about it, but it's no shocker to us.  We know what this team has been made of all along.  I said it over and over again, the pretty offense will always be the story line, but this team, a ton of heart.  Everybody that steps on that floor displayed a ton of heart.  So it's no shocker to us that we continue to fight, but we came up a little short and that's just it","Player"
55,2019-06-13,"Draymond Green","Postgame","Toronto Win","DRAYMOND GREEN: I think every game you leave something out there.  I don't think anyone leaves any game and feels like you did everything you could have possibly done to the T.  That's just a part of what, the game that we play.  Obviously the missed free throws, they usually come back and bite you, and they probably did.  But there was several things that went on throughout the course of this game which is why we lost.  So I think I can look at every loss in my career and every win and nitpick.  At the end of the day, we lost, so that's all that matters","Player"
56,2019-06-13,"Draymond Green","Postgame","Toronto Win","DRAYMOND GREEN: Oh, I mean, well, without Klay it's tough.  It takes some shooting off the floor, so spacing is not quite there.  Obviously one of our best defenders.  Probably the guy that got the most heart on this team.  It's not really the most popular opinion, but as a guy who's been with Klay for seven years, I don't know many people with as much heart as Klay.  So the way he was playing, as aggressive as he was, he was carrying us and when he went down obviously we lose a lot.  But","Player"
57,2019-06-13,"Draymond Green","Postgame","Toronto Win","DRAYMOND GREEN: Oh, I knew it was just to shoot the free throws.  But also with Klay he, if they would have let him stay out there he would have stayed.  That's just who he is.  You see him try to run back down the floor like, what are you doing?  But that's Klay.  How many people is going to play with a hamstring injury?  No one.  Like no one does that.  So that's just the way he is, man.  That guy is -- he's a warrior and obviously that's no pun intended with that, but there's no other way to describe him.  He's going to give everything he got every time he step on the floor and even some things that he don't have, which is his health.  He was going to try to give it more.  That's just who he is.  That's why we love him","Player"

We lost this year.  Clearly just wasn't our year, but that's how the cookie crumbles sometimes.  But, yeah, I hear a lot of that noise, it's the end of a run and all that jazz.  I don't see it happening though.  We'll be back","Player"
59,2019-06-13,"Draymond Green","Postgame","Toronto Win","DRAYMOND GREEN: No, I didn't.  But it does not shock me one bit.  Klay is, he's crazy, to say the least.  He is going to -- he loves to play basketball and no matter what he's got he's going to try to be out there on the floor.  So it's not shocking at all.  I'm sure he tried to get back out there on the floor and they just would not let him.  So, no, it sucks.  Obviously we're praying that everything is okay, but that's a tough one","Player"
60,2019-06-13,"Draymond Green","Postgame","Toronto Win","DRAYMOND GREEN: No, it wasn't on my mind.  I'm not an idiot.  I know that I can't get another T, so I'm not really going to flirt that line.  I think if you look at this entire year there was a lot of noise about players and officiating and the back and forth.  And I think over the course of the last eight to 10 week that is all has been cleaned up from both sides.  Officials I think were a lot better in communicating with us.  And I think players in turn showed the same respect to those guys.  So I had some conversations with officials today, and, but that's allowed.  I think that there's kind of this narrative of we don't work together.  We all work together to put a great product out there on the floor and represent this league the way we all want it to be represented, as we all are a part of the makeup of this league.  So I had conversations with officials.  But, yeah, I'm far from dumb as people think I am.  I know how to control myself a tad.  Just a little bit.","Player"

So many people deserve this.  Even though Golden State had some tough injuries the last game and this game, they showed you how much heart they have.  How much what it means to be a championship team.  They didn't make any excuses, they kept playing, they kept coming at you every possession offensively and defensively.  So very much respect for those guys and their organization.  With that said, I'm very happy that we won.  I'm so excited, it's just special, special feeling.  We have a special group of guys that are so carefree.  They help one another, especially through tough times when we could have pointed fingers at one another and blamed each other, we didn't do that.  We just held on to our brothers.  And just, I just have so many people to thank that we would be here for a couple hours, so I want to thank everybody","Player"

It was pretty simple.  You can make excuses and say like oh, it will take some time.  But at the same time we all invested, and we all thought let's help one another, let's be the championship team that we can be.  That doesn't mean that you are going to accomplish it, but the mindset was there and the will was there and the coaching staff was there, too.  And they pushed us every step of the way.  Then everyone that's around the team, it's first class.  It's just not an organization that takes shortcuts in any way.  And that doesn't guarantee you that you're going to win, but it helps for sure.  It does help.  And I thought that everyone is just so positive throughout the way even though when we were down 2-0 against Milwaukee guys, okay, let's get better, let's execute, let's help one another, let's do this, let's do that.  Nobody was blaming and kind of taking the shortcuts and kind of being negative","Player"
64,2019-06-13,"Marc Gasol","Postgame","Toronto Win","MARC GASOL: Just look at the roster, look at the roster of that team.  You look at the depth, the depth of them.  Then you look at the bench, you look at the young players that they have, you see the coaching staff, their mindset, you look at the front office, their mindset they have.  Go from top to bottom, ownership, the trainers, physical therapists, chefs, everything.  It's a top class organization.  They're all about winning.  And like I was telling your colleague, it doesn't guarantee you're going to win, but it does help that everyone has that championship mentality.  I'm so happy that they got it because everyone in Toronto and Canada deserves this because they fought for it.  I'm sure the Jurassic Park is going a little crazy right now, I just hope everybody is okay.  But I'm sure there's a lot of people very happy, because we have shown a lot of resilience and togetherness","Player"

So it's a different challenge now the world championship, but I'm going to be soaking in ice for a couple weeks.","Player"

They played amazing tonight all across the board, they had contributions, and, yeah, it's a tough feeling being on this side of losing in The Finals.  But I think a lot has been proven about who we are as a team and the fight that we have and all the adversity that we dealt with in this entire playoff run.  It's a one-possession game to keep our season alive tonight.  So we'll be thinking about this one, it's tough.  But our DNA and who we are and the character that we have on this team, I wouldn't bet against us being back on this stage next year and going forward.  So really proud of the way that we fought until the end and this five-year run's been awesome, but definitely don't think it's over","Player"

No regrets at all about, again, what we have been able to accomplish and even how this series ended.  So we had a lot of great memories in this building.  I think it's iconic in the sense of our entire history of this organization and how we got to this point.  Whenever I drive by it I'll have great memories of, again, what we have been able to accomplish in this building.  And as we move across the bridge, we want to be able to continue that and create new memories.  So hopefully every fan that was in this building appreciates the journey and the ride.

Not just in the face of pressure, he hit a lot of daggers that never seemed to panic when the ball was in his hands.  And even tonight he hit like three of them that kept the momentum on their side.  So obviously saw a lot of bodies on defense, but he was one that took the challenge.  And obviously he's a champion now.  So, well deserved","Player"
69,2019-06-13,"Stephen Curry","Postgame","Toronto Win","STEPHEN CURRY: Losing hurts no matter what the situation is.  Nobody likes that feeling whether it's a Game 7 or Game 6 or what have you.  I'll echo what Draymond said.  It's kind of how do you respond and what do you -- how hard do you work to try to get back to this stage.  Soak up this feeling, because obviously we celebrated, we have had champagne, we have had rings, but this is the more motivating feeling in terms of how do you respond, how do you turn the page to new challenges ahead.  So we'll be all right","Player"
70,2019-06-13,"Stephen Curry","Postgame","Toronto Win","STEPHEN CURRY: It's just tough in terms of a guy like Klay that left it all out there.  He was playing amazing tonight.  And to see a freak play like that where he lands awkwardly.  I don't know the diagnosis yet, but you think about the person and the guy and how much he loves to play the game and that's the only thoughts you have.  It's really not about what it means in terms of playing basketball.  It's just I'm more concerned about him as an individual than -- and hoping that's all right.  So I'll kind of leave it at that.  But the shot was one I take 10 out of 10 times.  And we ran a play that was kind of, we got a decent look off of kind of a bobbled catch, and I could see the rim, so I shot it.  I'll live with that.  We always talk about that, myself and Klay, in terms of shots that we take, you live with it.  I would shoot that shot every day of the week","Player"
71,2019-06-13,"Stephen Curry","Postgame","Toronto Win","STEPHEN CURRY: For sure.  In the history of this NBA you could highlight every team that was supposed to win or had the best team and all the different story lines.  And 82 games and a full playoff run, a lot can happen.  It's just a matter of how much you fight and just leave it all out there on the floor.  I think the way that we have talked and described this journey and whatnot, I don't think there's ever been a situation where we have taken anything for granted.  And that's something I can look back and just hold.  We all can hold our head high that we gave it everything we got.  To your point about two guys who go down and the game's kind of taken away from them in those moments, it's not a good feeling at all.  And it's kind of a helpless feeling in terms of two freak plays that send these guys back to the locker room.  So it's tough, but it's part of basketball, it's part of the game.  Again, I just hope their recoveries are strong and they come back better than they were before","Player"
72,2019-06-13,"Stephen Curry","Postgame","Toronto Win","STEPHEN CURRY: I'm not sure.  There's a lot of obviously decisions that will go into the summer and we'll deal with those accordingly.  But, yeah, I think true champions like we are, we should be able to adapt and keep this same kind of DNA no matter what our roster looks like next year.  And have high hopes about being back on this stage, whether it looks the same or not or obviously we're changing buildings and all that type of stuff, there is going to be some change.  But we'll enjoy this summer, like you said, it's been a long journey.  We've played a lot of basketball, get away from the game a little bit, refresh the minds, guys go through some rehabs and get back stronger.  Next season will be next season, and we'll come back with the right mentality.  So it's kind of hard to talk about because it's a tough way to go out and it's tough to lose in The Finals, but the story's not over yet.","Player"
73,2019-06-12,"Fred VanVleet","Practice","N/A","FRED VANVLEET: Just try to just stay locked in and be mentally strong and probably just not have any lapses.

74,2019-06-12,"Fred VanVleet","Practice","N/A","FRED VANVLEET: Probably just another higher level of focus.  I think that I found another step up of just trusting yourself and trusting your shot and not getting swayed by the moment and not changing your technique and not getting down when you miss a couple or changing anything and don't do anything drastic.  Just trust the work and the work is the only thing that will stay constant and remain steady the whole time.  And the same form that you shoot with when you practice is the same one you got to go out there and shoot with when there's a championship on the line.  And just trusting that, and that there's another level of like mental focus and locked in where can you kind of find that groove and that rhythm, and I think that's helped us","Player"

It's not a one-game series, it's not the end of the world when you lose, and it's not the greatest thing when you win.  It will be now, obviously, we're at three.  But trying to get four is tough.  And we had an opportunity to close them out, and we didn't do that.  Give those guys a lot of credit, they made some big plays late, and we just didn't do enough to win.  So we got another chance here tomorrow, and we got to go out there and play well and try to close it out","Player"
77,2019-06-12,"Fred VanVleet","Practice","N/A","FRED VANVLEET: Yeah.  Everybody in the gym probably knew Kawhi was going to be doubled, no matter where it came from.  I kind of knew what was on my left, so when I caught it, Shaun closed out to me, and I had Kyle and Marc versus Draymond.  So just didn't do a great job of exploiting that two on one there.  Marc was trying to pin him in and just couldn't quite get there.  So hindsight's 20/20.  We could have all done something differently.  But if Draymond doesn't get a finger tip on it and Kyle makes that three, then it's the greatest play ever.  So we got to understand that.  And if we're in that position again, we'll try to execute a little bit better and get off a cleaner look and learn from it","Player"
78,2019-06-12,"Fred VanVleet","Practice","N/A","FRED VANVLEET: No, I don't think that matters.  I think whatever play we would have ran or came up with, maybe the spacing could have been better.  But whatever plan we would have came up probably would have resulted in the same thing, Kawhi getting double-teamed, would have had to make a play out of it.  So it's not rocket science there.  And we lost and we didn't make the right plays.  So whatever we did was wrong.  And if we would have won, it would have been genius not to call a timeout.  So I don't try to get caught up in playing revisionist history","Player"
79,2019-06-12,"Fred VanVleet","Practice","N/A","FRED VANVLEET: Yeah, it's tough, man, it's tough.  It takes a lot of dedication and discipline.  And as much as people see us on the court and playing and playing at a high level, the rest of the 99 percent of the time it's probably dedicated to making sure we're able to perform at a high level.  So eating right, drinking right, trying to sleep as much as possible.  These two cities are not close by any stretch of the imagination, so the flights.  And just staying hydrated and getting treatment and still trying to find time to get your work in, that's what it takes to be a professional and to play at a high level.  So we have been at this thing, for us, like for young guys, I've been -- I don't have an offseason, so this time last year I was probably working out.  So to be still playing now is great, and you just got to continue to try to stay fresh and give yourself the best chance to go out there and play at a high level.","Player"

That's really all we're focusing on.  You watch the game and you pull out the most learning experiences you can -- about 20 to 25 on defense and 18 to 22 on offense and then a good segment, maybe 15 or so, on special teams.  Just go through them like any game","Coach"
90,2019-06-12,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: Now that is a loaded question, I think, isn't it.  Oh, my God.  Momentum is definitely real in everything in life, from the moment you get up to a basketball game moment.  No doubt about it.  Sometimes timeouts stop them; sometimes they don't.  Sometimes not taking one stops it and sometimes it doesn't.  That's kind of the world we live in on the basketball court.  You take them.  Sometimes you don't and sometimes you do.  Deep thoughts. (Laughter","Coach"
91,2019-06-12,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: Yeah.  I mean, we don't want to give up that many to those guys.  I think you got to guard them, got to find them in transition; they get a good chunk of them in that.  There was a bunch of loose ball ones, too.  But still, that's really no excuse.  We got to come up with a solution for that.  They had two in the first quarter, I think, where we stole the ball and were heading the other way, and then they kind of ended up with a loose ball and kicked it out to them wide open.","Coach"
92,2019-06-12,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: I don't know what makes him that way.  Probably, again, not basketball-related things, probably the way he was raised or the environment he grew up in.  He's certainly tough, strong and composed.  From the first preseason game to now, it continues to be interesting to just watch this guy do what he does.  It's without a doubt the best thing about this thing is that somehow I wound up on the sideline getting to watch this guy play up close.  It's really cool","Coach"
93,2019-06-12,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: Well, their impact on it, I think goes back a little bit to all the switching.  They just pretty much switch everything.  That really wasn't that common, to be able to come out and just switch every time somebody set a ball screen or a down screen or the DHO (dribble hand-off) or whatever screen and just switch, switch, switch, switch, switch.  Keep every player in front of you and not really have to ever put two on the ball, because they're all pretty good defenders.  So that's the biggest impact it probably had on the game.  I think a lot more teams do a lot more switching since they started doing that.","Coach"
94,2019-06-12,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: Did it hit me any harder?  Not really.  They all hit you hard.  Listen, I'm like anybody that was there that understands the outcome of that one changes things a little bit.  But I'll say this: I'm absolutely thrilled to be coaching in another Finals game.  This is awesome, right?  All these things when you look back on them, every single thing you do, if it doesn't turn out, you wish you would have called another play or had somebody else in or got somebody else a shot, et cetera.  I think if you remove that from it and you watch it, we ran a great play out of the timeout where Gasol absolutely got clobbered for a no-call.  Kyle had a wide-open three with a minute to go.  We ran some nice stuff and got exactly what we wanted?  I'm not sure that that timeout had anything to do with about 14 plays after that.  Maybe it did.  Maybe it didn't","Coach"
95,2019-06-12,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: Well, for some reason I think both teams are really good road teams and have been all season.  That's one thing.  Two, two really tough-minded teams playing, and you got to be a little more tough-minded on the road.  And I think a lot of those games probably could have went either way, but the momentum changed in whoever ended up winning them. (Smiling","Coach"
96,2019-06-12,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: Okay, first of all, Ryan is great dude.  Loved every day with him.  He was a super hard worker.  He started kind of as an intern for us at RGV.  But he always wanted to get into the management side of things.  I remember having a lot of meetings with him about player personnel in my office.  A really good worker who is climbing his way up the ladder.","Coach"
97,2019-06-12,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: Yup.  Good day.","Coach"
98,2019-06-12,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: That's a good one.  I think he's been able to show his full repertoire this whole season.  The playoffs has made it even more of a bigger stage.  Through the regular season, he's had big games like this before, but he hasn't played the minutes.  So you give him more minutes, you give him more shots, you give him more touches, you give him more time to be on the floor.  I think he's the best two-way basketball player in the NBA.  He just goes.  I've seen some stuff from him this year that just you say, Wow.  You appreciate the work that's put in.  He works extremely hard at his game and works extremely hard on his body.  And he loves this basketball thing.  He loves it","Player"
99,2019-06-12,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: I didn't know like he was such a great shooter.  I didn't know he was such a great -- this year alone, you say wow because he's gotten even better as a playmaker.  Early in the year, but then throughout the season, he's become a better playmaker.  He'll have games where 12 rebounds, 15 rebounds -- I think it was one game, I don't know if it was in the playoffs, it was like 30 (points) and 15 rebounds or something like that.  I mean you just say, God, Jesus, that's a crazy stat line for a guy like that.  He just does it on both ends","Player"
100,2019-06-12,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: We stayed in the moment.  We didn't finish the game out.  We all sat back, we watched it and watched the film today.  Got out here, got better.  Now we're going to go out here and get a little practice in, talk to you guys and prepare for the next game.  We understand that the moment is the moment, but we still are staying in it.  We're not too up, we're not too down.  We're just one game, hey, we lost it, now we got to move on to the next one","Player"
101,2019-06-12,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: Got two really good teams.  Two really good basketball groups.  Poised groups.  For us, we just go out there and try to play our game the same way no matter home or on the road.  We understand on the road we got to be even better because of the situation.  But for us as a group we just go in there, we stay focused and stay locked in on that moment of being on the road and being together","Player"
102,2019-06-12,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: Just go out there and do our job.  We're a professional basketball team.  We have been in the same situation.  We have been the same team all year.  We don't get too up.  We don't get too down.  We live in the moment.  We understand that today is today and tomorrow will be another test of who our group will be on the road.  We'll be against a team that will be ready to go, but we'll be ready to play too","Player"
103,2019-06-12,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: Get there when we get there.  Right now, we're just focusing on how we continue to get better.  Tomorrow will be a tough task, and we'll be ready to go.  We'll be ready to play basketball.  48 minutes on that hardwood and we'll go out there and do our jobs and play extremely hard","Player"
104,2019-06-12,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: Stay locked in.  I think they got loose last game.  Those guys are going to get off shots.  They're going to get up their attempts.  They're going to make shots. But you got to make them a little bit tougher sometimes.  They got a couple of loose ball offensive rebounds, transition breakdowns.","Player"
105,2019-06-12,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: I have.  Rick Adelman.  Very similar.  Never yelled.  Never really talked too. (Laughing.)  Great coach.  I think what Nick has done is kind of keep the mentality of our team the same.  He doesn't get too up, he doesn't get too down.  He yelled at us, literally, I think twice this year.  Kind of just attests to his confidence in who he is as a coach, who we are as a team, how he believes in us.  We are all grown men, and he talks to us as grown men.  We do our jobs and come in and work, and we're ready to go","Player"
106,2019-06-12,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: It's all game.  It ain't just down the stretch.  You got to be aware.  When they're on the floor, you got to be aware of them.  They're probably two of the top, whatever, all-time shooters in the game of basketball.  So when they step on the floor first quarter, second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter, you got to be aware of them at all times.","Player"
107,2019-06-12,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: Yeah, I think it will.  It hit me a little bit today driving here, it's like, wow, it's our last go round.  It's kind of like a memory lane, it felt like driving here today.  The memories, Deja Vu kind of setting in.  All the memories we made here just from my first year.  I think first year, first two years, thinking back about all the memories that we made here.  And then establishing myself to be here for the next three or four years after that, it's just special times","Player"
108,2019-06-12,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: Yeah, it really wasn't about, it wasn't really about that.  It was more so about the series and what we had to do to get back here.  But it was what we had to do going up to Toronto.  Obviously, the chance of Kevin coming back, just the dynamics changing in the series.  We were obviously excited to have him back, just the brothers banded back together.  I think we were more concerned about Game 5","Player"
109,2019-06-12,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: Yeah.  I really believe it's going to kind of hit us before we get here.  But once we're in the game, I think we'll be locked in to what it's going to take to win here.  I don't know if we'll be thinking about, man, it's our last game.  I think those feelings, those emotions, will more so hit us before the game.  And then God willing, we take care of business after","Player"
110,2019-06-12,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: Oh, it's been amazing.  It's really been home.  Like I said, establishing myself, my career here.  The longest, my longest stop is here since I've been in the league.  So just again, everything that I've been able to accomplish on and off the court from a personal standpoint, creating a life, creating a family here, again, it's been home.  It is home for me.  So it's definitely a special place along the way, along the journey here, it's a special stop for me","Player"
111,2019-06-12,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: More so just from a family standpoint, really deciding what the best interests of, whether it's moving or where we're moving to. And then I think even before that is do I want to play another year?  How is my body holding up, am I motivated to get in shape and play at this point in my career, somewhere else?  Where is it going to be?  It's not necessarily about the money, I don't think.  It's more so about do I want to, do I still want to play and how much do I love it and from a physical standpoint does it make sense","Player"
112,2019-06-12,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: Yeah.  We just, I think we draw on our experience, just being here.  We draw on that experience knowing that, just try not to get rattled, always staying poised, understanding we have some of the best shooters in the game that can get us back into any game.  And then guys that understand what it takes to win.  So we make winning basketball plays, whether it's getting extra possessions, I think understanding the moment and the time and score.  I think that's a big part of who we are.  It's a big part of our basketball ","Player"
113,2019-06-12,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: I would say so.  Yes, I would say so.  Just everything.  From a physical standpoint, guys going down, injuries, guys playing a lot of minutes.  Mentally, just adding up the cumulative effect of the last few years.  And then the emotional roller coaster it is.  But I think more than anything guys have been really locked in on just winning, what it takes to win.  I think we're putting our head down.  But for sure when it's all said and done it's like I think we'll kind of peak our heads up and all be happy.","Player"
114,2019-06-12,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: I don't know.  It really doesn't just come to my head.  It's just about going through a season.  Just being able to be the best player on your team, or one of the best players.  Once you keep going, reaching the steps and getting to the next round of the playoffs or just making it to the playoffs, I guess my mindset is just to keep playing and just want to win throughout the season.  You come into the playoffs with the same mindset: I want to win today's game, I want to win today's game.  And I feel like just having that carry over pretty much helps me or helps your team or players that get in this position","Player"
115,2019-06-12,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: I can't remember really any teachers' names.  Just really like math class more than any of my other classes, like English or history and things like that.  I guess it just made more sense to me to use in everyday life","Player"
116,2019-06-12,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: It's great to have teammates on your team that have confidence in you.  It helps give you extra drive, an extra push to be better.  When you play or don't play with someone, you can see how good or not good they are once you're on a team with them.  I guess he's seeing me now","Player"
117,2019-06-12,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: Just from any other game: Look at our mistakes, try not to make them again.  Go out there in the next game and just play with each other, have one focus and one goal and try to win it","Player"
118,2019-06-12,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: Once it happened, I thought about it a lot.  But as I got older, I pretty much just really stopped thinking about it.  I think it just gave me a sense and feel that life and basketball are two different things and just really enjoy your time and moments.  Like I always say, this is basketball; just go out there and have fun.  These are going to be the best years of my life, playing this game.  Being 27, this young, you shouldn't be stressing in life about things that really don't matter.  As long as your family is healthy, you're able to see the people that you love and you're able to walk, run, you're not injured.  So all those things go into account.  Go out here, lay it all out on the floor, do the best job I could possibly do and try to win","Player"
119,2019-06-12,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: Just from my own experience, I can talk from what I've been through.  Like I said, we work so hard to get to this point and the game gets taken away from you, especially with leg injuries and things like that, you're not really able to run or do anything on the floor.  So you really just have to change your mindset on things and try to attack each day of getting better and just know that you're going to play again one day.  You want to come back as the player that you were.  Make sure you come back when you feel healthy and you feel good enough that you feel confident enough in yourself to go back out there on the floor.  Know that that day will come.  And just like I said, attack each day.  That's your assignment, to get back to the thing that you love to do","Player"
120,2019-06-12,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: Definitely.  Even before it gets down to the stretch, you feel like you want to play great.  You want to make the next shot or get the next stop.  Like I said before about going through regular season and the playoffs, it's kind of your mind is into that already.  You got to carry over from either the first possession to the last possession.  You want to get a stop or a score.  To really say at that time like, Oh, I feel so much pressure.  You really don't.  I think once your adrenaline is going, it's a lot different than you watching the game because your mindset is totally different. You're within that moment, and you're embracing it and enjoying what's going to happen next.","Player"
121,2019-06-12,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: This has been just an incredible environment in which to coach and play back in the day.  Even when the Warriors weren't any good, to come in here as a visitor and feel the energy in this building, you could tell that the fans loved the game.  This was a basketball hotbed.  And just the atmosphere out there, the energy, the noise, over the last five years with our team's rise, combined with that organic energy that this place has always had, it's just been an incredible experience to coach here","Coach"
122,2019-06-12,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: My favorite memory is winning the Western Conference Finals in 2015.  We beat Houston in Game 5 to advance to The Finals.  It was surreal.  We weren't sure we were good enough to do it.  And the fans hadn't seen anything like that in 40 years, so that was, to me, when this sort of all started","Coach"
123,2019-06-12,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: I thought we played pretty well.  We could always do better.  But our guys competed like crazy.  That's the main thing.  Toronto is tough to guard because they have got a lot of passers and a lot of shooters and they put you in some difficult spots.  But everybody who came in was prepared to play and they were flying around and rotating.  We did everything we could to hang in the game on the road and we were able to pull it out.  So we know that's what it's going to take here as well","Coach"
124,2019-06-12,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: I'll answer the Lindsay question first.  Thrilled for Lindsay.  I've gotten to know her pretty well the last few years.  She's visited our practices many times.  I'm a transplanted Cal fan since I've had two kids there.  I'm disappointed for Cal that they're losing such a dynamic person and a great coach, but I'm thrilled for Lindsay.  What a great opportunity and a great hire by the Cavaliers.  She's a wonderful person and a hell of a coach.","Coach"
125,2019-06-12,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: A willingness to accept the consequences of missing.  Until you get to that point, it's going to be tough.  So you have to go into it knowing that even if you are the best in the world, you're going to miss half the time.  If you can hit half your game-winning shots, that's a hell of a percentage.  But if you go into it thinking, Oh, man, I don't want to miss, it's a big situation, then you're defeated already","Coach"
126,2019-06-12,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: Yeah, it does feel that way.  Obviously, two big hires in the last few days.  I think the women's game has gotten so much better.  Last year's WNBA playoffs were so compelling.  The Phoenix/Seattle series was incredible basketball.  I just think the talent that we're seeing, the level of play is probably helping women to gain positions in the men's game.  It's great to see and I'm really happy for Swin and for Lindsay, of course, and hopefully there will be many more.","Coach"
127,2019-06-12,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: You really don't think about it too much.  We have been in this thing for five years.  We really haven't been able to sit back and just reflect on everything.  Everything has kind of been hectic.  Kind of been like a roller coaster -- a circus more than a roller coaster.  We just focus on trying to get the job done and get the win","Player"
128,2019-06-12,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: Hopefully so.  You try to take any type of aspiration, and you put it into the game in the right way.  It can work both ways.  You just try to channel everything to positive action.  It's just a tough blow -- for the league too, being that he's the best player in this league, and what he brought to the league.  You just hope for the best for him and the way he's processing everything.  You want him to be healthy mentally","Player"
129,2019-06-12,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: Yeah.  It's been tough on him as well, coming back from injuries.  One of the tougher injuries that an athlete can have, with his Achilles.  The confidence can waver.  What he's been able to do to stay mentally in it and keep his confidence up and knowing what he's capable of doing and keeping himself engaged through good and bad times is a testament to his willpower and giving us a huge lift","Player"
130,2019-06-12,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: You try to tell yourself you've been through it and just use those experiences to hopefully propel you to winning the next game ahead of you.  Just keep the mind clear and try to stay laser focused and not let the noise deter you from where you want to go","Player"
131,2019-06-12,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: I shouldn't say just basketball players but athletes in general, especially talking about the ones that generate a lot of revenue.  The more revenue, the further you get away from the human aspect.  It's just a part of it and that's a different aspect that's becoming more and more in sports, especially when you talk about gambling now coming into play and how that's going to affect it.  Everyone is talking about the mental health aspect and things they're going to try to implement to make sure that their players are healthy mentally.  It's well said.  But it's got to be put into action and make sure we're taking care of our guys","Player"
132,2019-06-12,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: He obviously has the physical tools.  He's been blessed with those. When you have the physical tools, it's a fine line between those that work at it and get the most out of themselves or those that just run on talent.  He's one of those guys that has put the work in to get the most out of every aspect of the physical gifts that he's been given.  Mentally, he's very tough and understands the work he's put in.  He's got the confidence to match it.  He's playing freely and they're getting out of his way in terms of just letting him do what he does and everybody else follow","Player"

That's something that goes unnoticed and that doesn't show up in analytics.  It doesn't show up in any type of data, what a winner is.

I'm not going to be here to think about what I did in the past.  I'm here to think about what I can do better for my team tomorrow.  So that's what is in my mind.","Player"
138,2019-06-12,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: Hard to describe.  But he's a very good player and part of the reason is because he's a strong player.  He's a physical specimen that can move guys out of the way and get to the rim and get to his spots knowing that you know where his spots are, and you can't really stop him.  It just shows you how much his strength comes into play","Player"
139,2019-06-12,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: No.  We haven't really looked at or talked about those things.  We are thinking about it one game at time, game by game and we have an opportunity here to win.  Whether it's here or in Toronto, it's a basketball game.  Championship teams have to win on the road.  And it seems as if both these teams have been playing better on the road.  We have to continue to try to do that and hopefully win the next game and not allow it to go or extend it","Player"
140,2019-06-12,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: Yeah, a little bit.  Usually teams play better at home.  But in this series it's very different, it's rare.  Both teams have pretty much executed and done their job on the road.  We want to continue that, play our best basketball, and continue to play better basketball.  Regardless of whether it's at home or on the road, we need to step up, all of us individually and as a group and play better","Player"
141,2019-06-12,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: Just being comfortable with it and getting used to it.  I have to give a lot of credit and commend a lot of my coaches in the past, especially in San Antonio, with Chad Forcier and Will Hardy, even before that, of trusting me with taking certain shots.  Pop put me in positions to take big shots and so you take them and get comfortable with them and get used to them.  And like a guy like Kawhi, he's used to the moment.  When you're used to the moment, you kind of rise to the occasion.  When you're comfortable, you have fun and think these are the moments and times and positions that you dream of being in when you're a child, a kid.  You play in your driveway, wherever it is, counting down, five, four, three, two, one and taking those game-winning shots or game-winning free throws.  And you want to be a professional and step up, but you only to get used to it by being put in those situations.  So a lot of it has to do with my past teams and coaches of allowing me to step up to the occasion and be comfortable with it","Player"
142,2019-06-12,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: Both.  Obviously this was an opportunity, a missed opportunity, but luckily we have a lot of basketball to play and other opportunities to get it back, which we'll address it and then you move forward.  You don't want to dwell on it, you don't want to harp on it, you don't want to let it seep in or leak out or let it drain you, because that can be an emotional blow if you let it.  But we don't want it to be an emotional blow to our team.  We want to stay physically and mentally and emotionally confident and not doubt ourselves and understand that we know we can play better, offensively and defensively.  We only lost by one.  So we continue to do what we have done in the past or previous games to that game.  Figure it out, and then stay to their bodies and not let them get as many threes.  They shot very well.  And if we shoot better, we know we have a pretty good chance at winning the ball game","Player"
143,2019-06-12,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: Yeah.  Back then it was very different.  Usually he brings in the film the next year coming in.  So we addressed it the next year coming in and it was head on.  I don't think at the moment he would have addressed it too much because we had another game to play after Game 6.  But after Game 7 when it was over, the year -- the next year we definitely addressed it in film.  And we prepared every day as if we were going to get back to that point","Player"
144,2019-06-12,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: It's very difficult.  That's why we have our staff and our coaches, and those guys help to protect us from ourselves a lot of times.  Because we're so competitive, we want to play so badly regardless of what the injury, we think we can fight through it.  And he's a true warrior.  He had nothing to gain from playing the other night and everything to lose.  So for him to go out there showed a lot of heart, just for his brothers, his teammates and wanting to win, knowing that he had an injury that could possibly change his whole career.  So there's a lot of times where it's very hard to dictate, manage, and mentally say, I probably need to sit down, or I probably need to take myself out.  That's why we have a lot of those people around us, to help us protect us from ourselves","Player"
145,2019-06-12,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: For sure.  There's been plenty of times.  Even in the past year I probably, last year I probably should have sat out more than I did.  But the reason why it got worse than what it was is because I continued to play on it and tried to fight through it","Player"
146,2019-06-12,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: There's a bunch of games that I could put together.  We had some really good defensive stretches or defensive games.  Very few games where we had lulls and the team scored over 115 or 120.  A lot of times to keep them in the low 100s or under a hundred is tough to do.  But each one of them is very important.  Each game is important, and we probably need to be even better next game if we want to try to win this series.","Player"
147,2019-06-12,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: It's a special place.  I've been here now for seven years, a ton of great moments, a ton of great memories.  It's always a bitter sweet thing when talking about that.  Obviously it's the end of something special but I think also the start of something that will be even more special.  But for these fans that have endured plenty of tough seasons to possibly close this thing out to win a NBA Finals in the last season here, to win the last game here to send us to a Game 7 with a chance to complete the three-peat is special","Player"
148,2019-06-12,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: He's a good player","Player"
149,2019-06-12,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: He's a great player.  LeBron is obviously one of the greatest place we have ever seen.  Different players though","Player"
150,2019-06-12,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: They got two different names.  They're like different people.  Yeah, they're just different.  They're not the same person","Player"
151,2019-06-12,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: He's been playing great. We've done a good job of -- some games we're taking him out of the game and the other game he's gotten hoops.  And that's just the reason he's been the player he's been for so many years in this league.  We know what he's capable of, but you just got to do the best we can to try to make things tough on him","Player"
152,2019-06-12,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: I'm very aware.  It's not that tough.  Just play the game","Player"
153,2019-06-12,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: I don't know what they were thinking so I can't really speak on what their mentality was.  It was a rough moment","Player"
154,2019-06-12,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: That definitely comes into play.  That's a guy who we all have seen his love for the game of basketball.  For him to get back out there, as crazy as it sounds, I think he played for 11 minutes, I think those 11 minutes were enough to give us the spark that we needed.  So now we want to continue to try to build on that and do everything that we can to finish the series the right way","Player"
155,2019-06-12,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: Yeah, I don't think I've ever been coached by a woman.  I don't think so.  Maybe when I was a kid.  I can't remember.  Yeah, I'm not sure.  Possibly in elementary school.  But I really don't, I can't quite recall if I did or didn't.  It's possible though.  I don't know.  I'll have to check that","Player"
156,2019-06-12,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: I think the barrier's been broken at this point. Becky Hammon has been in the league. There are a few more. So I think that barrier has been broken","Player"
157,2019-06-12,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: No.  You've got to go win the game.  Trying to take extra emotion or whatever it is into the game ain't going to help you win it.  There's enough motivation to get to a Game 7 and try and win another championship","Player"
158,2019-06-12,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: Probably not.  Just because there are so many -- everybody is down, sad, mad, frustrated, disappointed, there's just so much emotion going on at that moment, that game could have went either way.  DeMarcus came off the bench, he stepped up big for us and it helped us keep the momentum or gain the momentum back.","Player"
159,2019-06-12,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: Well, you go back, you keep it objective as much as possible.  Within knowing that it's such an emotional time, you try to keep it as objective as possible, try to control the things you can control, the things that you must do better than did you in Game 5 and go and execute","Player"
160,2019-06-12,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: It gets a little harder, because you know more of the other team, they have know more of you, they're going to do probably more of the things that work for them.  Not so much that things that didn't work.  It's just kind of the same thing, just Game 6 now","Player"
161,2019-06-12,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: Even within the game I thought we did a great job of bouncing back.  Again, at the end of the game we just didn't execute defensively or offensively as good as we should to close it out.  But we were down quite a few points, I don't know, 14 points.  And it's not a bounce back game.  I think within the game, I thought that we did a really good job of staying in the moment, just like we did in the previous games","Player"
162,2019-06-12,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: I couldn't really tell what you it is.  I think it's just our nature as players.  Because as a team we haven't been together that long, so obviously our instincts as players, I think kind of that's what it promotes and I don't know.  I think you have a better sense of it than me","Player"
163,2019-06-12,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: Just take it as it comes.  And you can't expect the game to be played the same way, obviously, not from game to game, but within the game, they're going to make adjustments, you're going to make adjustments, they're going to take something away, open up something else.  It's just a matter of how many runs can you withstand and how many runs can you get.  And try to make obviously their runs a little shorter and avoid mistakes, especially the ones that we can control and make our runs a little longer","Player"
164,2019-06-12,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: It's a lot of -- I think any challenge is fun because it makes you better.  Any challenge you face it's always fun.  It gives you a chance to improve.  So I think that, I don't think we understand the meaning of fun the same way, maybe.  It's fun a couple -- after a couple beers and it's fun at those things, but it's fun too","Player"
165,2019-06-12,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: Well, you have to do a lot of reflecting and understanding and trying not to analyze too much.  Sometimes you can get caught over-analyzing and going too far ahead and just keep it as simple as possible.  Not just because you trigger somebody else's movement, and when you analyze you tend to take a little second","Player"
166,2019-06-12,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: Understand and visualize what's going to happen and what could happen.  And try to create space, have a good rhythm, the same thing that you practice over and over again.  Spacing, got to be correctly or better for us, and it's just a matter of being on the same page","Player"
167,2019-06-12,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: If you're in rhythm I think it's a lot easier at the end of games to take a shot.  When you're in rhythm it doesn't matter if it's two minutes left or two seconds left, if you're in rhythm, you're in rhythm.  When it changes and you have to do certain things to keep yourself in rhythm and just always your mindset always has to be you are in rhythm.  You might not be but always think positive and like you are in rhythm.","Player"
168,2019-06-12,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: It's definitely a real thing.  It's just a matter of can you capitalize on it once the next game starts and lock in and focus on details and kind of see the adjustments the other team is going to make, especially in the playoff series because that happens, they watch film, try to tinker a little bit.  But momentum and just confidence in terms of what we're trying to accomplish every possession, every quarter, in order to win the game.  It's definitely a real thing","Player"
169,2019-06-12,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","KLAY THOMPSON: I expect us to obviously come out and play as hard as we can.  We're not even thinking about the future.  We're just thinking about enjoying this last show at Oracle we're about to give our fans.  And I expect our fans to be the loudest they have ever been, especially in the name of Kevin and bringing his type of spirit he would bring to the fight and the competitiveness.  I know our fans will do that because we deserve it, but more importantly Kevin does for what he gave this team, this organization.  There wouldn't be banners if it wasn't for his presence.  So we expect our crowd to be loud for him","Player"
170,2019-06-12,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: He's a gamer.  He's shown that.  He's a Finals MVP back in the San Antonio Spurs days for a reason.  He just makes winning plays.  He's obviously expanded his game since then and shown offensively how dynamic he is.  He requires attention at all times.  So even a really good defense, sometimes he finds away.  For us, it's just playing the long game, understanding that he might have great numbers and whatnot, but it's just a matter of can we get the stops that matter and can we win the game any way that it takes.  He's just a competitor.  We respect that, for sure.  He's shown that again this entire playoff run that they have had","Player"
171,2019-06-12,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: This first 24 hours, there's not much you can say in terms of him going through the process, figuring out the extent of the injury and what the road map is going to look like coming back.  But I don't think much needs to be said about the motivation that we have or are going to have tomorrow.  Like Klay said, to protect our home court, feed off our crowd's energy, play for K and try to keep our season alive.  There are a lot of things that you can kind of tap into for energy tomorrow.  We'll be ready","Player"
172,2019-06-12,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","KLAY THOMPSON: I don't think we anticipated that to happen.  We just kind of go out there and play.  We're very in tune with each other being that we've played with each other for years.  So when we hit the open man -- Steph doesn't stop moving; that's how he got that curl three.  Same with me.  Draymond sacrificed his body, set a great screen.  So it just comes down to having the chemistry we do with the team and just playing that ball movement type of basketball.  Then on the defensive end I think is where we won that game, just Draymond and Andre making huge reads, two all-world defenders.","Player"
173,2019-06-12,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: I don't know much about the second part of that question.  But just in terms of when we're healthy and we have all those five guys out there, the chemistry is solid because we don't take over each other's spots on the floor.  We all bring something different to the table.  We work off each other really well.  There's a trust factor and just a rhythm to it on both ends of the floor.  I think we all just enjoy that pace that we can play with and the speed that we can show.","Player"
174,2019-06-12,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: I think in terms of being in The Finals five years in a row and being on this stage, it's hard to avoid those interactions with fans that want to kind of impose their -- or make their imprint on the series somehow, in some way, especially with social media these days.  I think it's kind of stupid, to be honest, in terms of people camping outside our hotel just to yell expletives at either us or our family members or whatever the case is.  But we handle all that stuff with class and try to ignore it the best we can.  And if they get something out of it, so be it.  But it doesn't affect us at all in terms of what we're trying to do and how we carry ourselves as a team as players and as people that represent us and our families as well","Player"
175,2019-06-12,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: Everybody has great 20/20 hindsight.  There are 24 hours in a day and there are a lot of different takes you can have on the situation like that.  In our cases, and as well as K and knowing him as a person and behind the scenes, we all want to play basketball.  If we have an opportunity to play or a chance to play, we want to play.  That's just how it is as competitors, and especially at this stage.","Player"
176,2019-06-12,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","KLAY THOMPSON: Oh, I agree with Steph","Player"
177,2019-06-12,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","KLAY THOMPSON: I guess he didn't win enough Finals MVPs to.  So, yeah, I don't know.  I mean, I think he is above and beyond a Splash Brother with his ability.  Me and Steph, we get as many jump shots as we want.  Still can't rise up and shoot over any man on this earth.  So I don't think we need to include him in the Splash Brothers to evaluate him on his talent and his skill, because it's pretty obvious to the human eye how good of an athlete, how great of an athlete he is.","Player"
178,2019-06-12,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: Klay is just stingy.  He wants that nickname for ourselves.  He's not going to be giving that out to anybody","Player"
179,2019-06-12,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","KLAY THOMPSON: That's just the nature of the game these days.  It happens to the greatest athletes to ever play.  Every athlete at his level has gone through it, whether it's been Kevin, Muhammad Ali, LeBron James, Michael Jordan, baseball players, Wayne Gretzky.  They have all been questioned, especially in this day and age with the media and the 24-hour news cycle.  There's going to be talking heads talking about his game and whatnot.  That just comes with the territory.","Player"
180,2019-06-12,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DEMARCUS COUSINS: I'm not really sure, but just make sure I'm ready when my name's called upon","Player"
181,2019-06-12,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DEMARCUS COUSINS: I'm healthy enough to play","Player"
182,2019-06-12,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DEMARCUS COUSINS: The same way I've done my entire career.  This didn't just happen, like, it's been an ongoing situation.  So I approach it the same way I always approach it","Player"
183,2019-06-12,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DEMARCUS COUSINS: It will be an emotional night, regardless.  Last game in Oracle, so I'm sure the fans will be fully engaged and there's going to be a lot of emotions and a lot of passion in the building, so it's going to be an epic night for sure","Player"
184,2019-06-12,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DEMARCUS COUSINS: Coming out and playing the right way, keeping the goal in mind, which is winning the game, whatever it takes to win the game.  The rest will handle itself","Player"
185,2019-06-12,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DEMARCUS COUSINS: There's been ups and downs this entire playoff run, so obviously we all feel for K.  I mean we feel for, I mean Klay went through it, I went through it, Loon's going through it.  Draymond's gone through it.  There's been a lot of ups and downs, like I said.  So it sucks to lose key pieces to the team, but we just got to find a way to grind through it and make something happen","Player"
186,2019-06-12,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DEMARCUS COUSINS: I leave that to y'all","Player"
187,2019-06-12,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DEMARCUS COUSINS: This team is together regardless.  Obviously, we got one more thing to kind of motivate us.  Obviously we want to come out and try to win this thing for K as well.  So I guess you can say it's another added motivation","Player"
188,2019-06-12,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DEMARCUS COUSINS: It's been pretty weird.  It's usually tougher to win on the road, but usually you kind of play better at home.  But that's not really been the case for either team.  So hopefully we change that tomorrow","Player"
189,2019-06-12,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DEMARCUS COUSINS: Usually kind of lean on one another more, just psychologically.  From a mental aspect you kind of lean on each other more.  I don't know, this is a weird situation.  It's not really an answer for it, but mentally you definitely lean on each other more on the road.  So that's the best way for me to put it","Player"
190,2019-06-12,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DEMARCUS COUSINS: I talked to KD","Player"
191,2019-06-12,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DEMARCUS COUSINS: We spoke","Player"
192,2019-06-12,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DEMARCUS COUSINS: It's nowhere near even close for that, right?  We spoke, you give him space, you let him go through his ups and downs of emotions.  Obviously you just give him his space, and then I feel like I'll reach out when it's the right time.  Or let him reach out when he feels it's the right time","Player"
193,2019-06-12,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DEMARCUS COUSINS: It's a tough process just straight up.  Nobody don't really understand that type of an injury unless you go through it yourself.  So it's tough.  It's tough","Player"
194,2019-06-12,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DEMARCUS COUSINS: It's more mental than anything.  For sure.  It's more mental than anything","Player"
195,2019-06-12,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DEMARCUS COUSINS: Just feel the fight.  No matter what type of adversity hits this team we find a way to try to fight through.  So that's all we can do","Player"
196,2019-06-12,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DEMARCUS COUSINS: We appreciate you through thick and thin.  Hopefully the love and support continues.  I can't really say anything about being able to afford it, that's not really my lane, but we appreciate it","Player"
197,2019-06-12,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DEMARCUS COUSINS: It's not a concern.  Lock in even more.  We understand the void we have to fill.  The next guy has to step up which has been done numerous times throughout this playoff run, so we expect the same thing.","Player"
198,2019-06-10,"Klay Thompson","Postgame","Golden State Win","KLAY THOMPSON: It's tough.  Really it sucks, man.  I feel so bad for those two, especially Kevin.  I don't know the extent of his injury, but that's never fun, man.  For him to put his health on the line to come back and compete at the highest level, he's one of the best to ever do it, and we were trying to win this for him.","Player"
199,2019-06-10,"Klay Thompson","Postgame","Golden State Win","KLAY THOMPSON: We do it for Kevin.  We do it for K.  We know -- I can tell you this, he wants us to compete at the highest level, and we'll think of him every time we step on the hardwood","Player"
200,2019-06-10,"Klay Thompson","Postgame","Golden State Win","KLAY THOMPSON: No, I just keep pressing on.  You can't be out on the court thinking of, I hope I don't get injured.  That's when you get injured.  So for me I just try to refocus, man, but that was very deflating","Player"
201,2019-06-10,"Klay Thompson","Postgame","Golden State Win","KLAY THOMPSON: I knew we would come out and compete.  Obviously having Kevin helped so much, especially on the offensive end.  You saw it there for the first quarter, his shooting was dearly missed.  DeMarcus Cousins, what a game, he came in, affected the game on both sides of the ball.  Steph with those timely threes and just his ability to keep shooting.  Even when he sees a lot of misses, he doesn't care.  He's the best shooter ever, so he's never going to lose confidence.","Player"
202,2019-06-10,"Klay Thompson","Postgame","Golden State Win","KLAY THOMPSON: It obviously inspires you to play harder knowing your best player can't be out there.  You think of him every time you dive for a loose ball or go for a rebound, because I know him and I know how bad he wants to be out there, that's why he was out there.","Player"
203,2019-06-10,"Klay Thompson","Postgame","Golden State Win","KLAY THOMPSON: We have been doing this for years, so it's natural.  It's not that we think we have to take on the scoring load, but when Kevin's not out there we -- the ball's going to find us a little bit more because obviously you know what he can do, averaging 35 a game in this post-season run.","Player"
204,2019-06-10,"Klay Thompson","Postgame","Golden State Win","KLAY THOMPSON: Well, we have been down big before, we have been down fourth quarters, late in games, and Coach Kerr drew up a couple great sets and me and Steph just got clean looks and you don't want to give us too many of those because they will go in most of the time","Player"
205,2019-06-10,"Klay Thompson","Postgame","Golden State Win","KLAY THOMPSON: Yeah, our goal was to get them back on the plane, get them back to Oakland.  We owe our fans one more game in Oracle.","Player"
206,2019-06-10,"Klay Thompson","Postgame","Golden State Win","KLAY THOMPSON: I mean, when you're on the defensive end, all you are thinking is press up on your offensive player and crash the boards as hard as possible.  We're not even thinking about scoring when you're on that side of the ball.  You just got to take it one play at a time.","Player"
207,2019-06-10,"Klay Thompson","Postgame","Golden State Win","KLAY THOMPSON: I don't think today showed it.  If anyone watched the last three years of basketball, you saw this man was the Finals MVP back to back.  So all that, those talking heads who say we're better without him, that's just ludicrous.  Like that's crazy.  This is the best player in the world.  You could put him on the 30th best team in the league, and that team will make the playoffs.  That's how talented he is.","Player"
208,2019-06-10,"Nick Nurse","Postgame","Golden State Win","NICK NURSE: Well, for me I was -- I really felt for him, right, I know he was probably not a hundred percent and he gave it a shot tonight, right, and just made kind of a move on his own and he went down kind of on his own, I think, without a collision or landing on something, so you knew it was probably not good.","Coach"
209,2019-06-10,"Nick Nurse","Postgame","Golden State Win","NICK NURSE: Well, again, I don't get a lot of that aura but I did get some reaction from guys on our bench, and some of the guys on our bench were really shook up.  And I even know at halftime when they came out and I don't know what the official word is, but somebody on the bench said he tore something.  And I know Kyle was on the bench sitting there and was shook up by that, and both Klay and Steph stopped and talked to Kyle there at halftime on our bench about it.","Coach"
210,2019-06-10,"Nick Nurse","Postgame","Golden State Win","NICK NURSE: We didn't take a timeout there on that last play, right, but we let them play and Kawhi had it and they doubled him, and he moved it to Fred, and moved it to Kyle, and we just didn't quite have enough space there.  I thought it looked like it was going to be a really good shot, an open corner three, but I didn't see who got out there and got a piece of it.  But again, I was confident we would come down and play and make the right decisions and get a good shot.  I have a lot of faith in those guys.","Coach"
211,2019-06-10,"Nick Nurse","Postgame","Golden State Win","NICK NURSE: No, not hard at all.  I think that I always, I think after Game 2 in the Philly series I said, listen, I expect this to be a long series, right.  I expect this one to be a long series.  I'm not sitting here trying to think we should be this, be that, but if you would have probably told me at the start of this thing if we could fast forward to a 3-2 lead, you want to take it?  I would probably say yes","Coach"
212,2019-06-10,"Nick Nurse","Postgame","Golden State Win","NICK NURSE: Talking about Kyle's at the end?  You're not thinking about all that stuff, really.  I think, again, you're just trying to win a game, and you're not thinking about anything other than that.  I think you always just got to play out the possessions and do your best to get the best shot you can get, and whatever happens after that takes care of itself","Coach"
213,2019-06-10,"Nick Nurse","Postgame","Golden State Win","NICK NURSE: Those two we took at three-minute mark?  Yeah, well, we had two free ones that you lose under the three-minute mark, and we just came across and just decided to give those guys a rest, and we had back-to-back ones there that we would have lost them under the three-minute mark, and just thought we could use the extra energy push","Coach"
214,2019-06-10,"Nick Nurse","Postgame","Golden State Win","NICK NURSE: Well, I think that in this day and age, up six with three minutes to go doesn't mean a whole lot.  You got to keep playing and getting good shots and keep guarding.  We have been a really good close-game team this year, both ends of the floor.  We really guarded in the second half; we held them to 22 each quarter, and I felt good at that point.  Just needed to make a couple more plays.","Coach"
215,2019-06-10,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: I mean a little bit.  The reports have been coming out since Game 1, I think, that he was going to play by Game 3.  So we prepared each game, 3, 4 and now 5, so it wasn't like it was a total departure from everything we have been doing.","Coach"
216,2019-06-10,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: Yeah, I think we have to, right, I think that these games are tough and we realize how hard we have had to play and we have really tried again to make it a focus, even from the beginning of training camp that we weren't going to get super caught up in the results, that those things would take care of themselves and I think that our focus tonight is on doing the work, right.","Coach"
217,2019-06-10,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: Yeah, well, he brings everything, right?  He first of all, brings an explosive transition game.  He'll race up the floor and pull up from across half court, like a couple of their other guys do.  So it's another threat in transition you got to get ready for.  They have got a package of stuff they run for him.  There's a lot of the 3-5 mid-pick-and-rolls, there's the Curry-Durant pick-and-roll, there's a Durant-Curry pick-and-rolls, there's some pin-down plays that he runs where he isos the side of the floor and then there's a post-up game.  So that's a lot of stuff.","Coach"
218,2019-06-10,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: I think so, but again they have a different starting lineup every night.  We don't really get caught up in the matchups, really.  Once we get out there and see who is out there, each guy points to one of the guys they're going to take and then we go from there.  There's a lot of switching going on and a lot of early subbing from both teams, as well.","Coach"
219,2019-06-10,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: Yeah, again, I keep giving you the same answers is that it's critical.  It's a critical game, as those were, right.  Game 2 against Orlando at home was critical.  Game 3 at Orlando was critical.  So that's really how it feels.  Each game in these playoffs feels like a must-win, a critical game, and that's how we're approaching it","Coach"
220,2019-06-10,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: Well, I give most of that credit to Kawhi because I said it in the locker room trying to kind of not make it feel so bad that we just lost a home game in the Finals.  I was like, all we got to do is go get one, that's maybe not as insurmountable challenge to go out there and get one.  And Kawhi said, expletive that, let's go get them both","Coach"
221,2019-06-10,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: Yeah, I mean, yeah, he'll certainly guard him.  One of the big things with Durant is you got to have somebody that can -- well, you don't really have anybody that can look him in the eye, but at least maybe the chest up.  You can't get too small on him or he'll shoot over the top of you.  So Kawhi's one of our bigger defenders, along with Pascal, Serge would probably guard him, again, that's the biggest thing.","Coach"
222,2019-06-10,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: It's hard not to be aware of some of it, but again we have done a pretty good job of getting here and getting in the office and shutting the door and watching the film and keeping the guys in and walk through upstairs and things like that.  I don't know, I think they have handled it all pretty well.  But it remains to be seen.  I guess, we got to wait until the ball goes up.","Coach"
223,2019-06-10,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: Yeah, no, we're good.  Everybody's good.  Full of energy, ready to go","Coach"
224,2019-06-10,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: He's ready to go","Coach"
225,2019-06-10,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: I don't know about that, but he is ready to go.  He's been cleared health-wise for the last couple games, but again it just depends.  It's situational.  We're pretty happy with our rotations here for the last 8, 10, 12 games.  But he's ready and he may get out there.","Coach"
226,2019-06-10,"Bob Myers","Postgame","Golden State Win","BOB MYERS: Because I am the president of basketball.  If you have to.  I don't think there's anybody to blame, but I get it, that stuff happens.  I hope nobody does, I don't think it should land on anybody, but if you feel like you need to..","President"
227,2019-06-10,"Bob Myers","Postgame","Golden State Win","BOB MYERS: Sports is, it's people, sports is people.  I know Kevin takes a lot of hits sometimes, but he just wants to play basketball and right now he can't.  Basketball has gotten him through his life.  So it means, I don't know that we can all understand how much it means to him.  He just wants to play basketball with his teammates and compete","President"
228,2019-06-10,"Bob Myers","Postgame","Golden State Win","BOB MYERS: The initial injury was a calf injury.  This is not a calf injury.  I'm not a doctor, I don't know how those are related or not, but it's a different injury.","President"
229,2019-06-10,"Kyle Lowry","Postgame","Unknown","KYLE LOWRY: We tried to get to Kawhi to his right side, they doubled off him.  He swung it to Freddie, and Freddie had a look and he threw it to me in the corner, and Draymond got a piece of it.  He blocked it.  I'm not going to miss it; he got a little piece of it.","Player"
230,2019-06-10,"Kyle Lowry","Postgame","Unknown","KYLE LOWRY: Yeah, it felt great out of my hand.  He got a piece of it, that's what great defenders do.  He got a piece of it and we'll continue to look at it and see how we can be better for the next game","Player"
231,2019-06-10,"Kyle Lowry","Postgame","Unknown","KYLE LOWRY: Yeah","Player"
232,2019-06-10,"Kyle Lowry","Postgame","Unknown","KYLE LOWRY: Well, I think that I don't think the fans knew the significance of the injury.  They kind of just seen he went down.  In this league we're all brothers.  At the end of the day, we're all brothers and it's a small brotherhood and you never want to see a competitor like him go down.  You don't know what the circumstances are.","Player"
233,2019-06-10,"Kyle Lowry","Postgame","Unknown","KYLE LOWRY: No, we stayed in the moment.  They came back and made three straight threes.  Played some good defense down the stretch.  We just missed some shots and they did what they were supposed to do","Player"
234,2019-06-10,"Kyle Lowry","Postgame","Unknown","KYLE LOWRY: Man, I just asked if he was okay.  That was it.  And the emotions, I don't know what their emotions are down there, but like I say in this league it's a small brotherhood, and we don't want to ever see any of our fellow brothers go down","Player"
235,2019-06-10,"Kyle Lowry","Postgame","Unknown","KYLE LOWRY: I think the fact that Steph and Klay were able to get off 14 and 13 threes is too many.  They got off way too many threes.  For guys like them, they're going to make -- you give them that many threes, they're going to make some.  So we let them get too many threes off.","Player"
236,2019-06-10,"Kawhi Leonard","Postgame","Golden State Win","KAWHI LEONARD: Really didn't have nothing drawn up at that point.  They got a turnover, and I got the ball at the top of the key, as you've seen, and the double team and swing, swing, just didn't get it off quick enough","Player"
237,2019-06-10,"Kawhi Leonard","Postgame","Golden State Win","KAWHI LEONARD: They're dangerous.  Obviously KD makes them a different team, they have been here before and that's probably a question you're going to have to ask them.  I'm just focusing on our team and what we got to do next game.","Player"
238,2019-06-10,"Kawhi Leonard","Postgame","Golden State Win","KAWHI LEONARD: No, other than KD, that was a big difference in the beginning.  But they just pretty much, they played fast early on, trying to get buckets in transition early, and obviously they made 20 threes tonight, Klay and Steph hit some big ones late in the game","Player"
239,2019-06-10,"Kawhi Leonard","Postgame","Golden State Win","KAWHI LEONARD: At that time I felt that, like you said, he probably wanted to get us some rest at that moment.  You never know, I mean, if we would have won the game, we wouldn't be talking about it","Player"
240,2019-06-10,"Kawhi Leonard","Postgame","Golden State Win","KAWHI LEONARD: I think they scored like nine points in a minute, back-to-back threes.  They got some easy looks, Klay got a wide-open look twice.  Steph came off a pin-down, got an open look and he hit the three as well.  Pretty much we had a big turnover when we were up three.  K-Lo tried to swing it back to Marc, he just wasn't there to catch the ball, and that was pretty much the ball game right there.  They came down, hit a three, and another three and we weren't able to score","Player"
241,2019-06-10,"Kawhi Leonard","Postgame","Golden State Win","KAWHI LEONARD: Like what do I think about his situation?  It's devastating.  Like you said, you work so hard to get to this point, these are the last games, you see him try to come out and push himself, but obviously he tried to do a move -- and I feel bad for him.  I've been in that situation before.  I hope he has a speedy recovery, and just gets healthy and I hope that he's going to be okay mentally, just throughout the whole rehab process.  Because like I said before, we work so hard to either play in the Finals or just play in the NBA, and when you're not playing, it's hard to wrap your mind around it.  But I'm pretty sure he's going to attack each day and get better and come back strong","Player"
242,2019-06-10,"Kawhi Leonard","Postgame","Golden State Win","KAWHI LEONARD: I mean, just try to come out and match that emotion and that drive.  Come out and do the same thing, just be mentally focused, try to limit our mistakes, and be the aggressor.  Just play hard 48 minutes and see what happens.  Play confident","Player"
243,2019-06-10,"Kawhi Leonard","Postgame","Golden State Win","KAWHI LEONARD: Well, I mean two guys came up on me, I don't know if I could have got a shot off.  It's hard.  If you got two guys on top of you, you have to try to find the right play.  We ended up getting a shot in the corner, but it just didn't go off quick enough","Player"
244,2019-06-10,"Kawhi Leonard","Postgame","Golden State Win","KAWHI LEONARD: I was just pretty much fight through adversity.  It's not going to be easy, stay confident.  We know we can win and that's it.  I'm not going to say everything, but those are the main key points","Player"
245,2019-06-10,"Kawhi Leonard","Postgame","Golden State Win","KAWHI LEONARD: I think a couple of us were playing a little bit too fast on the offensive end.  But we scored 28 points in the first quarter, could have played a little bit better defense, like guys were getting open shots.  I guess nerves probably settled down from there and we started to play a little better basketball.","Player"
246,2019-06-10,"Kawhi Leonard","Postgame","Golden State Win","KAWHI LEONARD: I think he will recover from it.  I was just saying like, I hope he's keeping his spirits up through it.  I know he's going to get through it.  He's a great basketball player and he wants to come back and be a great player, Hall of Fame player.  But the simple fact that you're just hurt, like I was saying, and you want to get out and play, but you really got to just take your time and be patient and let the weeks and months go by.","Player"
247,2019-06-10,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Golden State Win","STEVE KERR: I don't think that I can, honestly.  I just told the team I didn't know what to say because on the one hand I'm so proud of them, just the amazing heart and grit that they showed, and on the other I'm just devastated for Kevin.  So it's a bizarre feeling that we all have right now.","Coach"
248,2019-06-10,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Golden State Win","STEVE KERR: I've been here five years, so I don't know, a hundred-plus games times five years, I've seen it an awful lot.  It doesn't happen every night but it seems to happen most nights.","Coach"
249,2019-06-10,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Golden State Win","STEVE KERR: I believe Bob Myers is going to come in and speak on the health front.  I don't really know much.  Bob was back there during the game, he'll have more information","Coach"
250,2019-06-10,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Golden State Win","STEVE KERR: Again, I'm going to leave that to Bob","Coach"
251,2019-06-10,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Golden State Win","STEVE KERR: Yeah, I thought DeMarcus was fantastic tonight.  He stayed ready.  He didn't get the first call for that second-quarter run.  We went to Bogut and then with the injury we knew we needed his scoring and he stayed ready and played a brilliant game.","Coach"
252,2019-06-10,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Golden State Win","STEVE KERR: I think we went down six, if I'm not mistaken, and maybe it was five, I don't remember, was it five?  Six?  But Steph and Klay hit back-to-back threes, I believe, we got stops.  Our defense was bending down the stretch but we didn't break and the last stop was tremendous.  Amazing defense on that last play from all five guys.  Draymond's block, he covered so much ground on Kyle's shot from the corner.","Coach"
253,2019-06-10,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Golden State Win","STEVE KERR: I've seen it over and over again.  So it's not really surprising, this is who they are.  They have accomplished so much over the years, and that doesn't just happen and it doesn't just happen with talent.  There has to be more that goes into it and it's that fight, that competitive desire that I talked about and that ability to stay poised under pressure.  It was brilliant to watch","Coach"
254,2019-06-10,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Golden State Win","STEVE KERR: Yeah, I mean, it had made it difficult, especially with the start that we got off to and Kevin was playing so well, so it was a real shock when he went down.  So I give our guys credit, they hung in there and expanded the lead and kept us in a pretty good spot going into halftime","Coach"
255,2019-06-10,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Golden State Win","STEVE KERR: I didn't say anything.  There was nothing to be said.  The Raptors players were telling the crowd to be quiet, out of respect, which I appreciated.  Some of the fans were cheering when it happened, and I think the Raptors players understood how serious it was and they sort of quieted the crowd.  There was just a couple minutes there where it all seemed so eerie and strange, and it took maybe a little bit for both teams to collect themselves.","Coach"
256,2019-06-10,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: He responded well and, yeah, he's going to play","Coach"
257,2019-06-10,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: Are we really going to go into it that deeply?  He can play now.  He's been cleared, so he's going to play","Coach"
258,2019-06-10,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: I haven't researched every 3-1 deficit, but generally speaking when you get to the Finals or the Conference Finals you got two great teams, and so if a team can get a win when it's 3-1 and make it 3-2, they got some momentum.  So that's the idea, that's the whole idea tonight is play better than we have been playing and get some momentum early, win one game and then the tenor of the series changes.  So that's our goal","Coach"
259,2019-06-10,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: Well, even without having played he's still such a huge threat and he can get his shot off against anybody and we'll see.","Coach"
260,2019-06-10,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: I don't think there is one.  I think we just have to play better as a team.  I'm more hoping that Kevin's return can sort of normalize the bench players' roles.  Guys get into routines in the NBA and they're used to playing with certain combinations and playing certain roles.  It's tough when you move pieces around.","Coach"
261,2019-06-10,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: Well, Andre's obviously going to play a huge role in the game.  He does in every game that he plays.  The center position, we have kind of played for years with a center-by-committee approach.  So we'll find combinations and we'll go from there.  But I'm not going to sit here and tell you exactly what I'm going to do","Coach"
262,2019-06-10,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: Well, yeah, the strength of playing that way is the versatility in the scoring, and so we have that option.  We haven't really had that option so far in this series.  We did it for a few minutes I think in Game 2.  But, yeah, we have got that as an option","Coach"
263,2019-06-10,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: I'm sure Patrick's been giving them the entire playbook and the scouting report.  I have no idea","Coach"
264,2019-06-10,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: Same thing that stands out in every series that I've ever been involved in, player, coach, GM, one game turns a series.  It changes the momentum, it changes the feel.  And so the whole focus is just win a game.  So you don't need to look beyond tonight, you just need to go out and play well and win a game and then go from there","Coach"
265,2019-06-10,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: Well, Kevin's insertion changes quite a bit for us and so we have an idea of how we're going to play and what our rotation will look like, and of course I'm not going to tell you then","Coach"
266,2019-06-10,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: We got to cut down our turnovers.  We had 19 the other game, and got to improve our defense.  I thought we played a good first half of defense, but it's going to require a full game of solid defense.","Coach"
267,2019-06-10,"Stephen Curry","Postgame","Golden State Win","STEPHEN CURRY: Everybody gets so wrapped up in chasing championships and the greatness that you see on the floor, but life is more important in terms of caring about an individual and what they're going through on a daily basis.  And you see the commitment and the challenges and just the what's been thrown at KD this whole year, really.  And he gave us what he had, he went out there and sacrificed his body, and we know how it turned out.","Player"
268,2019-06-10,"Stephen Curry","Postgame","Golden State Win","STEPHEN CURRY: Honestly, I don't know.  It was kind of an emotional moment all the way around.  Something told me just to go back there.  I really don't know what I said or what he said, it just sucks, man.  Like I don't really know what else to say about it.  So that's it","Player"
269,2019-06-10,"Stephen Curry","Postgame","Golden State Win","STEPHEN CURRY: When you're on this level of greatness and everybody's kind of poking and producing trying to narrate your story and tell you who you are, who you should be, what decisions you should make constantly over and over and over again, it's part of what comes with this territory.  But it's just, when you get to know somebody and see how genuine they are and how committed they are just to playing basketball and having fun and living life a certain way, you root for those type of guys.  And like he said, whatever his outward appearance is or whatever he says to the media or whatever, like at the end of the day the people that know him, know what type of guy he is and know how special of an individual he is.","Player"
270,2019-06-10,"Stephen Curry","Postgame","Golden State Win","STEPHEN CURRY: Sometimes the spirit tells you what to do.  You don't really make decisions, you just act on it.  So I can't tell you what went through my head, it just felt right","Player"
271,2019-06-10,"Stephen Curry","Postgame","Golden State Win","STEPHEN CURRY: I don't know.  I mean, it's going to be a rough go in terms of just trying to recalibrate.  We have been up -- until this point it's been about our hope that he could play and our hope to stay alive in this series, the emotional roller coaster what tonight was.  Get on this flight tomorrow, go back to the drawing board when we get home, and I think the biggest thing, the biggest advantage is being at Oracle Arena one more time, where our fans can really get behind us, and we're going to have to will ourselves for another 48 minutes to stay alive.  And whatever it's going to take from every single guy in our jersey.","Player"
272,2019-06-10,"Stephen Curry","Postgame","Golden State Win","STEPHEN CURRY: I've been in this city for -- I've lived here, I really enjoyed the people and their passion and excitement for not only the game, but just when you come into town they just enjoy life and they're nice people.  Very confused around that reaction.  It's not my experience with the people of this city, and I commend obviously Danny Green and Kyle Lowry especially I think they were the ones that were kind of signaling to the crowd, like, let's check ourselves a little bit.  You understand this is about an individual, a human being and not, oh, shoot he's out, he's hurt, we won the championship.  Like that was probably their initial thought and you hate to see that when a guy's going through pain like that.","Player"
273,2019-06-10,"Stephen Curry","Postgame","Golden State Win","STEPHEN CURRY: We made a lot of different statements over the course of these five years.  Win or lose, I don't feel like we need to prove anything anymore.  It's just about can we get the job done or not.","Player"
274,2019-06-10,"Stephen Curry","Postgame","Golden State Win","STEPHEN CURRY: I think it goes back to what Bob was saying about him being misunderstood in terms of what's important to him.  Playing basketball is important, being a good human being is important, selflessness of, like you said going through a situation like he's going through right now, he has the initiative to go speak to an entire fan base and to hype us up as his teammates and his brothers.","Player"
275,2019-06-10,"Stephen Curry","Postgame","Golden State Win","STEPHEN CURRY: I think just in terms of the opportunity we have in front of us in two days, we'll be suiting up in front of Oracle Arena and like you said, with the amazing atmosphere and opportunity to play for him, and to kind of honor the sacrifice, I guess, he made in terms of putting his body on the line tonight.","Player"

But all kids out there, you should wear mouthpieces, but it was a weird play, and I took an unfortunate shot.  And so now I will be wearing a mouthpiece for as long as I can manage it, and I'll probably throw it at some point during the game but I'm going to try","Player"

It gets harder and harder and harder and that's what makes the playoffs so tough, each round gets more difficult and these guys have been very difficult to play against, and it's taken a lot of excellence on our part to try to get it done and nothing's going to change that.  We have to continue to take care of what we have been doing and really play at another gear, and we still got room to grow, which is great, this team can get better, we can play better and we look to do that tomorrow night","Player"

You're not going to get knocked around like that, if you don't stick your nose in there sometimes, and it was an unfortunate play but it happens, it's basketball.

We have had our backs against the wall before with this same group.  I mean, even last year, being down 3-2 [against the Houston Rockets].  Obviously, it's a little more daunting being down 3-1, but usually when our backs are against the wall, we respond the best.","Player"
287,2019-06-09,"Klay Thompson","Practice","N/A","KLAY THOMPSON: The biggest key?  I think there are two of them - it's focus and passion.  The talent side, the skill, putting the ball in the hoop, that will take care of itself, especially when we play with more passion than the other team, when we play with a great focus.  That's when you see the best type of basketball in the world from us.  It starts with our leaders tomorrow, including myself.  We'll come in the arena with the right mindset","Player"
288,2019-06-09,"Klay Thompson","Practice","N/A","KLAY THOMPSON: Well, that's a great question.  I just try to enjoy the journey.  It's been a very long one since we have been on this championship run.  It started way back, 2014.  You wish to have no end in sight, but everything that's great always comes to an end.  So whether that's tomorrow or four years from now, you never know.  That's the beauty of life.  You just got to go out and enjoy every minute with the group of guys you got, because in professional sports nothing is ever guaranteed.  You can look back on any professional league and see that.  There are so many examples in the history of the sport.  So that's what keeps me in the present moment","Player"
289,2019-06-09,"Klay Thompson","Practice","N/A","KLAY THOMPSON: I did not feel good after the game","Player"
290,2019-06-09,"Klay Thompson","Practice","N/A","KLAY THOMPSON: Oh, I mean a little sore, but just more mentally and emotionally just kind of -- it sucks losing at this stage.  Any Finals loss is hard, so you got to digest that.  But physically, I feel great.  Like I said, I was like 80 percent the other night, so I'll be inching closer to 90, closer to a hundred hopefully by tomorrow.","Player"
291,2019-06-09,"Klay Thompson","Practice","N/A","KLAY THOMPSON: The hardest part about being an athlete is going through injuries, especially when your team is playing for a championship.  It sucks.  I feel for Kevin.  I know what type of competitor he is and we obviously miss him dearly.  But whether it's tomorrow or Game 6, we just have to do everything in our willpower to help him get back, If that's win a game and be patient, then we got to go do that.","Player"
292,2019-06-09,"Klay Thompson","Practice","N/A","KLAY THOMPSON: What I remember from that is just the same I'm feeling now.  It's just basketball and you just got to go get one to start.  I'm using the motivation of bringing one back to Oakland to help.  We feel like the city of Oakland deserves one more game at least.  So if we want that to happen, we got to go out and take care of business tomorrow.","Player"
293,2019-06-09,"Pascal Siakam","Practice","N/A","PASCAL SIAKAM: No.  It's an NBA Finals game and it feels like Game 1.  So that's kind of the mentality that we have going out there and just giving everything we got.  Obviously we know what's at stake, but because it's the NBA Finals and I think the best thing is just to not get ahead of ourselves and just continue to work the game and we can't cheat the game","Player"
294,2019-06-09,"Pascal Siakam","Practice","N/A","PASCAL SIAKAM: Well, I think just having each other's back is a big thing, we know that it's a big deal and we know that it means a lot to the country and the whole organization, but I think what helped us is just staying together and understanding our goal and just focusing on the game.  The rest you can't control that.  We got to focus on the game, we got to be able to win the game, we got to do everything right to be able to win.","Player"
295,2019-06-09,"Pascal Siakam","Practice","N/A","PASCAL SIAKAM: It was crazy.  I think, I feel like it's kind of weird to say that, I feel like I'm used to it a little bit just because they have always been there everywhere we went, like it didn't matter where we were at, I mean Raptor fans were everywhere and I think that's what makes them so special, just knowing the support that they give us and it doesn't matter where, like we always feel like we're at home","Player"
296,2019-06-09,"Pascal Siakam","Practice","N/A","PASCAL SIAKAM: It's going to take that, all the things that it took us to win every single game that we had.  It's going to be a battle, it's going to be hard, but at the same time if we stay together and do everything we're supposed to do, we have a chance.  We have a good chance to put ourself in a position to win.  So that's what we have to do, we have to prepare and be ready to go out there and give everything we got","Player"
297,2019-06-09,"Pascal Siakam","Practice","N/A","PASCAL SIAKAM: I don't know, exactly, but I think I kind of said it one time, I just like that a move was spicy, and they kind of said Spicy P, I guess they took it there.  But, yeah, it's all fun.  The fans love it, so","Player"
298,2019-06-09,"Pascal Siakam","Practice","N/A","PASCAL SIAKAM: Yeah, for sure, definitely part of what we created and that blueprint, and just being able to be that foundation of what Toronto basketball is about and obviously outside that have we always kept in contact.  We're always really good friends and I'm sure that they're happy to see us at this level right now. I talk to Delon most of the time and CJ, and all of them.  So I think the connection is always there and at the end of the day beyond basketball we are friends","Player"
299,2019-06-09,"Pascal Siakam","Practice","N/A","PASCAL SIAKAM: For me the biggest thing, and I mean, if you don't want to talk about the basketball part, just how great he is, I guess.  I think just the way he's been able to handle situations, like I know we always talk about it and it seems clich√©, but he is just kind of even-keeled, and he's always the same person.  No matter if you're winning or losing or whatever the case might be, he always has that, just that swag, that everything is going to be okay.  You can always see in his eyes that at any given time he can kind of take over","Player"
300,2019-06-09,"Pascal Siakam","Practice","N/A","PASCAL SIAKAM: For sure.  That's why you have a leader like him and having guys like Kyle and Danny that's been there that know what it takes, so that's definitely a blessing for us being able to learn from those guys and kind of embrace that part of it.","Player"
301,2019-06-09,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: Yeah, there's still a lot of work to do.  We got to keep some focus and improve on some things and make some adjustments and do the work.  I think there's a lot of basketball to be played yet.  Again, we try to ignore what the score in the series is and be more concerned with making it a one-game series, if we can","Coach"
302,2019-06-09,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: I don't think so.  I got a lot of work to do yet.  I still keep reviewing and we put our ideas together of what they may change personnel-wise or coverage-wise or what they may run against some things they see that they have added here in the last game or game or two.  Just keep mulling it over until you get to decision time before the game tomorrow","Coach"
303,2019-06-09,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: No.  I just know we got to go win another game.  I've tried to do that all through the playoffs, just look at the next game and go win it.  I imagine everything will take care of itself from there","Coach"
304,2019-06-09,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: They have been good.  I think our collective ","Coach"
305,2019-06-09,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: It's certainly something I've never seen before.  I've never coached at this level where we have had this type of expertise.  From my standpoint, I'm not sure half the time I know what the hell he's doing.  I just know that I trust him a hundred percent.  He's got tremendous experience.  He's innovative.  When he tells me guys are ready to go, I play them.  When he tells me guys aren't ready to go, I don't play them.  If he tells me guys need to play 10-minute stretches, I do my best.  I don't always do it, but I do my best to keep it at 10 and under.  Whatever it is, that's the level of trust that I think I'm lucky to have.  It's not fun trying to guess who can play, who can't play or whatever.  We just leave that up to him and his staff","Coach"
306,2019-06-09,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: I don't know specifically from that game.  I felt that one of the times I felt really good in this playoff run was Game 1 at Milwaukee, which we lost.  We just hit that dramatic buzzer beater to advance.  We got on the plane the next day and had to play less than 48 hours after that.  I thought we came out and played unbelievably tough.  The ball didn't bounce our way that night.  We didn't get any breaks.  But I thought we outplayed them for the course of the game.  And then when we went down two to them, our guys were like, We're okay; let's just get back home and get one and we'll get this thing turned around.","Coach"
307,2019-06-09,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: So the first one, I always, again, learn this stuff when I come to press conferences.  I don't hear much about any of that stuff.  The only thing that I saw, when I got to my condo building last night, they had a thing in the elevator, a big picture. They had a watch party in our condo building and had a little thing in the elevator, so I wouldn't miss that.","Coach"
308,2019-06-09,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: He's a real professional.  I've stated this before: When I speak in the meetings and when I speak in a film session or when I speak in a huddle, he's always looking at me and a lot of times he's nodding his head.  I've always said for a rookie head coach, that makes you feel okay, right, when a guy like him is actually looking and sometimes agreeing with what you're saying.","Coach"
309,2019-06-09,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: Kawhi certainly sets that tone, but so does Kyle, so does Marc, so does Danny -- those four guys.  And then I think the younger guys take the cue from them.  I think they like playing together.  I think they know there's work to be done.  I just think they just know there's not a whole lot of energy to spend on celebrating before time.  Let's hope we understand that.  We're going to see tomorrow night.  We have handled it so far, and let's see if we can handle it again.","Coach"
310,2019-06-09,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: Probably Kawhi, Nick Nurse, Danny, Marc.  I think we just have a bunch of guys that are in the moment, understanding that we're just going to keep playing and keep working.  Kind of just been like this all year, to be honest","Player"
311,2019-06-09,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: Not when you've been doing it all year.  Not when it is your team.  It's what we have done all year.  Even in training camp, it wasn't like, oh, talking trash.  It's like, Let's come in and get our work in and boom, boom, boom, let's get out of here.  Let's work and get going","Player"
312,2019-06-09,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: We didn't do nothing yet.  We haven't done anything.  We still got to get one more win.  It's the first to four.  You got champions coming in here and they're going to play their butts off and play extremely hard.  For me, we still got to focus on us and take it one possession at a time","Player"
313,2019-06-09,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: I don't know.  If he plays, he's an MVP.  He's an All-NBA player.  He's an All-Star, Finals MVP.  He's really, really talented.  Really, really good.  But we can't focus on that.  We have to focus on ourselves.  That's one thing we have done all playoffs is kind of focus on ourselves.  Go out there and play how we need to play and grind it out and do what we need to do as a team","Player"
314,2019-06-09,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: Yeah, it definitely improved through the years as a pro.  Every day isn't given to you.  You wake up every day, you just should be happy you wake up every day.  People ask me how I'm doing and I say, I'm great; I'm alive.  That's kind of the staying-in-the-moment thing that I've always lived by.","Player"
315,2019-06-09,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: Just being alive.  I'm here playing basketball for a living.  I'm healthy, my kids are healthy.  Family's good.  Life's pretty good","Player"
316,2019-06-09,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: What my mom had to go through and my grandmom had to go through, feeding myself, my brother and my cousin and my little cousin and my other little cousins.  Going to work, getting up at five in the morning and going to work and making me cereal, having a bowl of cereal sitting in the refrigerator with some milk and being able to provide for me and my brother and my family.  That's pressure.  That's pressure to me.  Just being willing to do whatever it takes to make sure that your kid will see better than what you've ever seen.  Getting up and taking public transportation an hour and a half away.  People like that are heroes to me -- just going to work and grinding and doing whatever it takes to provide for your family and protect who you have to protect","Player"
317,2019-06-09,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: Yeah","Player"
318,2019-06-09,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: I think what the other group, not we wouldn't have been happy, but we would have been -- it is what it is, like a little bit maybe a smile or two.  Now, we've just been like this all year.  Kind of just like, We haven't done anything.  You don't do anything in this league unless you win the trophy.  You can accomplish this or that, but at the end of the day we have certain goals and standards that we want to reach.  I think that's the one thing that we have all kind of just like -- our end goal would be a championship.  And that's what we have been working for all year","Player"
319,2019-06-09,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: Individually, just kind of what I've done -- rebounds, rushed shots from the floor.  We're at such a good age nowadays where you can look up and see what's going on in your stats, so you don't have to look at the box score as much.  But as a team you look at points off of turnovers, transition points.  Second-chance points is one thing I look at.  Rebounding, I think that's one thing that I always look at to see where the game was.  You can't really tell the game from the stat sheet, but can you see what's going on.  Free throw line, free throw attempts.  There's a different mixture of things","Player"
320,2019-06-09,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: I'm not -- that's a crazy question.  I ain't never been asked that one.  I don't know.  I will put it this way: I was once a kid and I was once in your shoes.  To be able to know kids one day will want to be like me, I hold myself to a super high standard.  I want kids and you to see a man that's really professional, really about his business, but at the same time he's still fun and loving and everything else.","Player"
321,2019-06-09,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: I think fans around the world and our fans, I think '93 was the last time they have had a chance to [celebrate a championship when the Blue Jays won the World Series].  I don't know, were the Montreal Expos still here?  They had two teams at the time.  They had a team to celebrate across the country.","Player"
322,2019-06-09,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: We have been on the right side [of 3-1] and been on the wrong side. The main thing I think is just drawing from experience, being able to put that into perspective, knowing not to panic.  It's not about being a hero; it's about putting our head down, grouping together and not panicking.  Staying poised and staying in the moment.  Knowing that it's just going to be a game at a time right now","Player"
323,2019-06-09,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: More so from an urgency standpoint.  48 minutes, playing every possession like it's our last.  You look at it as obviously the opportunity.  You want to keep playing, and if we don't come out with that mentality, that sense of urgency, it could be it.  So more so using it as fuel to bring us together","Player"
324,2019-06-09,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: That's it.  One game, one quarter, one possession can swing the game.  It's just get that momentum going.  Especially at this stage, you got some of the best players in the world playing.  You get confidence, you get a feel and then from there it's just downhill","Player"
325,2019-06-09,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: A little bit of both.  You take the experience of where our mindset was when we were playing Oklahoma City.  But Toronto is a different team.  We're also playing for a championship, so the stakes are a little higher.  But more so just trying to draw from that experience.","Player"
326,2019-06-09,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: I would like to think he would make a difference.  Again, it's just any time a player of that caliber comes back or goes out of the lineup, it's going to be felt certain ways.  We'll see what happens tomorrow.  Hopefully he comes back, but at this point we prepare like he's not playing because he hasn't been playing.","Player"
327,2019-06-09,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: I think we draw on the experience from each other.  The five, six guys that have been playing this late in the season the last couple years, we're all kind of distributing leadership throughout the team with maybe the guys that haven't been here, maybe the bench guys, and just banding together that way","Player"
328,2019-06-09,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: We haven't looked at the tape yet.  But again, to me, it's going to be won on the defensive end of the floor.  We probably didn't score as much as we would like the last two games, but we got to leave it all on the floor defensively","Player"
329,2019-06-09,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: Yeah, I would say the inconsistency of the lineups, just because it throws off our rotations and it's just hard to get a rhythm all the way through.  But it's the playoffs.  Everybody is playing injured.  Everybody is playing with some sort of injury.  So we just have to adapt.  I think we have done a good job of adapting so far, but at this point it's just about wins and losses.  So we don't make excuses for that","Player"
330,2019-06-09,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: I think we have had that same mentality since we started the playoffs.  Looking at it knowing whatever may happen this summer, it happens, but being in the moment, right?  Trying to get to the top of the mountain.  Trying to get to where we are now with a chance to win a championship.  That's our goal.  That's our mentality.  That's our perspective.","Player"
331,2019-06-09,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: Just stay in the same routine and just focus what's in front of me.  Obviously, as you said, human beings, we do think in the future.  Been thinking in the future since the beginning of the season, just trying to get to this point.  You just got to stay current and stay in your routine, be patient and not rush anything","Player"
332,2019-06-09,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: Obviously you're playing against a better team, a championship team. That's pretty much the only difference.  Other than a regular playoff game, you're just playing against a better team at that point in time","Player"
333,2019-06-09,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: I think we have been embracing it this whole time.  Just enjoying the support and the energy that they're bringing to the team.  With that being said, they help us stay focused in the moment.  You just got to be patient.  Don't rush anything. Stay focused on what we're doing. Just take it a minute at a time","Player"
334,2019-06-09,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: No, it didn't.  It didn't happen yet, no","Player"
335,2019-06-09,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: It is pressure with any game.  I don't think it's any added pressure to it.  We still have to go out there and play a basketball game.  Whatever game or significance of the game or time, you always want to play great defense and make a shot.  It's pretty much just a title over it right now.  Just go out and play.  Play it, enjoy it and whatever happens we'll see the results","Player"
336,2019-06-09,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: Yeah, the year I had last year and then just being able to play in The Finals this year has been great.  But I've been happy just being able to return to basketball at the beginning of the regular season.  It's pretty much something that I look back on of not being able to play and now I'm able to play.  So just enjoy it. It's why you're here.  You never know when those times will come when you're not going to be able to play or you get injured.","Player"
337,2019-06-09,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: Looking at rebounds, turnovers and field goal percentage for each team.  Obviously, points in the paint and just seeing what were the runs.  That's pretty much it.  But the big three things that I look at are turnovers and rebounds and field goal percentage","Player"
338,2019-06-09,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: Just growing up playing basketball, pretty much.  Like I always said, just learning from past experience, past games that I lost, games that I won.  Seeing what I felt like or what I was thinking at those specific times and just bringing it back to current-day reality, the moment that I'm in.  Making sure I can use the things that were good and delete the things that were bad to help me be more successful","Player"
339,2019-06-09,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: I'm still trying to get better every day today with it.  Either with basketball or off the floor.  It's an everyday battle","Player"
340,2019-06-09,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: I think it's just we're focused.  We know that it doesn't mean anything until someone has four wins.  You never know what could happen and you got to take advantage of it and don't get overly hyped and excited.  Still a great basketball team on the other side.  I think that was our mindset.  We had a goal going out there, and we accomplished it.  Now in a possible three games, we have to win one.","Player"
341,2019-06-09,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: He's going to practice with us today, and he'll get some extra work in with some of our younger players.  We'll gauge it from there","Coach"
342,2019-06-09,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: Yeah, because what he's going to do today he hasn't done.  He's doing more today and then we'll know more after that","Coach"
343,2019-06-09,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: I agree with Kyle.  We play basketball for a living or coach for a living.  We're among the luckiest people on earth.  I don't know if that was Kyle's angle, but that's how I approach things.  It's all perspective.  We are incredibly lucky to live the lives that we do and to be here competing for an NBA championship.  When you talk about pressure and daunting tasks and all that, just look around the world.  We're doing all right and we're lucky and we know how lucky we are.","Coach"
344,2019-06-09,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: I think that the mood is good.  We still got plenty to play for.  Yesterday was a travel day.  We didn't do anything, so it's not like we spent a lot of time together.  Today we'll watch the film and go through practice and talk about the things we can clean up.","Coach"
345,2019-06-09,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: Yeah, the game plan changes if Kevin is out there or if he's not.  So you adapt accordingly.  It changes matchups, it changes rotations, all that stuff.  That's true all regular season you deal with that, so you're constantly adapting and adjusting according to who is available","Coach"
346,2019-06-09,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: Very well.  Yeah","Coach"
347,2019-06-09,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: We just look at everything game to game in terms of matchups, combinations. One of the things that's been a bit of a struggle with the injuries is just finding the right combinations in terms of the numbers that we have and how many minutes guys are playing.  We're just trying to find patterns that can help everybody who is out on the floor and go from there.","Coach"
348,2019-06-09,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: Yeah, when I was a kid I watched the NBA.  I watched the players, the games.  I remember one of my first memories was watching the Lakers pour champagne on each other when they won the title with Wilt Chamberlain.  I'm going to need a little help, '71?  Anybody?  All you old people out there?  (Laughter.) Let's hear it from the geriatrics.  What year was that","Coach"
349,2019-06-09,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: '72.  So the Lakers won in '72.  I was six and a half years old.  I watched all those players pouring champagne on each other, and I thought that looks like the most fun anybody could possibly have.  And so as I got older and continued to fall in love with the game, I dreamt of being able to do that.  Then I got a little older and wiser and I realized I'm never going to get to do that.  I'm not good enough.  And so I really didn't expect to play or to coach in the NBA.  So it's all kind of literally been a dream come true.  I know people say that offhandedly, but that's really the truth and it really seemed like a dream and it's come true.  So thanks for the question","Coach"
350,2019-06-09,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: For sure.  That's what we're hoping is the case, but we'll see.  There's no doubt all that stuff matters.  I think we just keep saying we got to just play with whoever is out there and that's the truth.  The last game with Klay and Loon was a much better indicator of our team than Game 3 was.  And so we had a better opportunity and we were more competitive.","Coach"
351,2019-06-09,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: Yeah, I thought late third quarter our energy waned and our focus waned.  We made a lot of defensive mistakes that seemed borne from just the frustration and maybe fatigue, just from we're playing guys heavy minutes and all that stuff.  That's why I'm pleased that there will be two days before the next game and the next couple after that, if we can keep extending the series.  As we get healthier and have some time to heal and rest, I like our chances.  So we'll see what happens.","Coach"
352,2019-06-09,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: Well, you try to take experiences in general and use them going forward.  You don't know exactly what part of it you can use, but just from a mental aspect knowing that you can, it's capable of being done, but it's harder and harder as each game goes on","Player"
353,2019-06-09,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: Well, we have done some good things in each and every game, they have just been able to make the right adjustments.  So we feel like you got to have close to perfect game and that's taking care of the ball, limiting second-chance opportunities, they have done a really good job of finding a different guy each game that's had a huge impact.  Serge was incredible for them last game, getting to his spots, the trapping of Kawhi a few times.","Player"
354,2019-06-09,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: That's just a part of it.  Like I said, no matter the outcome, our preparation from adjustments within our team to adjustments we have to make on the fly, guys are locked in and ready to go.  Like I said, we're playing against a tough group, a hungry group, a fresh group.  They never been here before, so there's that level of excitement that you can't replicate that.  Once you're there more than once, it gets harder and harder.  But they're a fresh group, so they're bringing it every night and that's going to raise our level of play and that's what makes the game better.","Player"
355,2019-06-09,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: It's one of the harder games to win.  It seems like it never ends.  The game just never ends, it just keeps going on and on and on.  So from our aspect, we want to make sure that it happens.  We get to that point, where it feels like our fourth win is the longest game ever and hopefully continue to take it one game at a time","Player"
356,2019-06-09,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: No, I don't think we look at it that way at all.  Especially for myself I've been, a lot of people have spoken to me each and every day, especially with kind of our -- the folks that cover us, and I'll be here next year for sure, and I'm pretty confident that we'll have our core back and we'll try to make another run at it.","Player"
357,2019-06-09,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: Our group, we don't think about that too much.  We try to use that experience and say we have been through it, but we don't need that as motivation.  Just being in NBA Finals is enough motivation and believing in ourselves and understanding, cleaning up the mistakes we made and a few other key adjustments.  And we got a group that's locked in.","Player"
358,2019-06-09,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: I think you have to embrace it.  When your backs are against the wall, you got to go out and show what you're made of.  Being down 3-1, obviously the odds are against you.  But we just got to go out and win one game and take it from there, one game at a time","Player"
359,2019-06-09,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: I don't really know how he's progressing because we're in the middle of The Finals and we really haven't had much time to practice.  When we do practice, it's at an arena.  So it's not like you see the typical rehab progression as if it's in the regular season and everything is normal.  But obviously for him to be practicing today means he is taking steps in the right direction.  We'll see what that means for tomorrow. Obviously hopefully it means he's able to play and give whatever he can to the team","Player"
360,2019-06-09,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: Well, obviously it's tough to come and win any road game, let alone a closeout game where they're going to come out and try to give their best shot and the fans are going to come out and give everything they have.  It's a tough environment.  But nonetheless we played in tough environments before.  You just have to come out and go possession by possession.  Try to play mistake-free basketball and trust in the results","Player"
361,2019-06-09,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: I feel great.  We still have an opportunity to go out and win a series and that's all you can really ask for","Player"
362,2019-06-09,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: Every series is different.  It's not necessarily that that series wasn't in the NBA Finals, but every series is different.  It takes on a life of its own.  But most importantly the same message that was applied then should be the same message that is applied now.  Like I said before, let's take it one game at a time.  You go out, you play every possession like it is your last and understand what's at stake.  You give everything you got and you live with the results","Player"
363,2019-06-09,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: It's just about who is going to play harder, who is going to get the 50/50 balls, who is going to defend well and do the necessary things that it takes to win a game of this magnitude","Player"
364,2019-06-09,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: I think we got to take everyone else out.  I think Kawhi has been playing great, and when you're playing against a great player like that, very rarely are you going to completely take them out of the game.  You just try to make it tough on them.  But everyone else is playing well and I think that's what we have to do a better job of.  You do what you can on Kawhi and try to make it as tough as possible, but you can't let everyone else play as well as they have been playing","Player"
365,2019-06-09,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: Every game you're trying to figure something else out.  That's just the nature of a playoff series.  It's a chess match.  You're always trying to do something to get an advantage.  You're trying to figure something different out in every game.  That's never going to change","Player"
366,2019-06-09,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: Yeah, it is what it is.  You play the cards you were dealt.  You adjust however, any way that you can.  Obviously, they've been pretty consistent in their lineups and who is at the center spot.  We have been kind of trying to figure it out with adding DeMarcus back in and then Loon going out.  But nonetheless that's no excuse.  It is what it is","Player"
367,2019-06-09,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: I really have no feelings about it because I don't personally think it's the last time.  So, yeah, I didn't walk out of there like, Oh, man it is my last game at Oracle.  So, yeah.  It's a little different for me","Player"
368,2019-06-09,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: It's not really something that you focus on during The Finals.  The Raptors are a tall enough task to focus on rather than sitting and worrying about, Is this it?  There are a lot of things going on, a lot of things that you got to focus on. That's not really something that you sit and worry about","Player"
369,2019-06-09,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: I think we definitely have to get the pace to where we want it on both sides of the ball, which means stopping them in transition but also having some transition opportunities of our own.  We always say we're at our best when we're getting stops and pushing the tempo.  That's what's worked well for us over the years, and in Game 5 we have to make sure we do a good job of that.","Player"
370,2019-06-09,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: Going to take lot.  Obviously, we know how good they are.  They're going to continue to fight.  We have to treat the series as if we're down in the series","Player"
371,2019-06-09,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: I don't think we're thinking about that as much.  The pressure is on both sides, but for us more so than anything.  We're not the champions.  The pressure is always on the opposing team, the team that's trying to dethrone the champs.  They're three-time champions.  In order to take that away from them, we got to be on top of our game and execute","Player"
372,2019-06-09,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: Very hard.  Knowing that teams are going to be fighting for their lives, their back is against the wall, they have a lot more to lose.  We got to play as if we're down in the series and our backs are against the wall, that this is our last game","Player"
373,2019-06-09,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: A huge factor.  They're the greatest sixth man in the world, helping us night in and night out.  Helping us close out series, helping us win series and helping us this series to hopefully bring it home","Player"
374,2019-06-09,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: We're taking everything from each series.  Each series has helped us to come to this point.  I think that's why we are where we are right now is because of how well and how much we have had to adjust and how battle-tested we are as a group","Player"
375,2019-06-09,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: It comes with experience.  It comes with ","Player"
376,2019-06-09,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: I think there are a number of guys in the room leading that charge.  As you can see, everybody's persona was the same after the game.  It wasn't just like as soon as the game is over somebody went in and told us, Hey look, this is how you got to act.  I think everybody was just like that before we even got to the locker room, before we even got a chance to talk to each other.  As I said, it's appropriate fear, that necessary focus that we need to be able to make this thing happen","Player"
377,2019-06-09,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: It makes him a special player.  Obviously, that's what he came into this league as -- a long, active defender.  But he's emerged offensively a great deal.  He's been that for us.  With him, Pascal, their length, their ability.  Serge protecting the rim.  Even Marc, his length.  It allows me and K-Lo defensively as guards where we can get up in our guys and trust them behind us to be able to have our help at the rim.","Player"
378,2019-06-09,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: It's like the previous series against Philly and Milwaukee and even Orlando. every game gets tougher and tougher because they take things away from the other team, and fundamentals mean so much on every possession.  you can't give up anything easy to anybody because you understand that anything easy is free and you can't give anything free","Player"
379,2019-06-09,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: Huge.  Huge role, obviously.  He's the head coach.  They do a great job, Nick and his staff, of preparing you for games, breaking down film, giving you confidence on the schemes defensively and their tendencies and how we're going to help and communicate and do all those things, and also giving you freedom and confidence to execute and do what you do as a player.  So obviously, it's huge.  Huge.  A huge part of what have we done","Player"
380,2019-06-09,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: You don't analyze that as a player.  It's a different scenario, different role, situation.  You have so many other important things to do and to prepare for than to analyze his health or another player physically","Player"
381,2019-06-09,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: Picture this?  No, but I was fortunate to live three of them with my brother.  I went to watch two of them.  Actually, I watched live and one of them I watched from the TV.  So it was a lot of fun.  We had a great time and he won two of them","Player"
382,2019-06-09,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: Yeah, but not really about basketball.  We have been talking like brothers talk -- about [each other], not about basketball","Player"
383,2019-06-09,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: I'm sure that outside the locker room people will talk.  You see how many people are here, and everyone has an opinion and says different things about the game.  For us, it's more about doing every little thing that we need to do to win the game. Hopefully, we'll put enough possessions together where we'll win the game","Player"
384,2019-06-09,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: You're not outside as much as maybe four months ago, so you don't get to leave as much.  But it's a good feeling.  That kind of excitement, it's a positive energy. It's definitely not bad.  Everyone has bumps and bruises and has some active issue physically, so that encouragement and that passion makes you feel a little better","Player"
385,2019-06-09,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: It was great.  It was surprising because it's not easy to get tickets for The Finals.  You have to go around a lot of things to get down there.  It was very good to see.","Player"
386,2019-06-09,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: I don't know.  I think this is, just thinking about what's happening now, it's hard to kind of compare just because everything, all my mental energy and whatnot is focused on the task at hand right now, being down 3-1 in The Finals.  We haven't been in this position before in The Finals, but playing OKC and the whole 2016 run, where we were on both sides of this equation, you can kind of relive those experiences and understand what the emotions were like and how important literally every possession of those potential closeout games were on both ends, and what it took for those comebacks to happen.","Player"
387,2019-06-09,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: I don't think it will change much at all.  It's just having another powerful weapon out there that can do some very dynamic things on the floor.  We'll be able to adjust in transition pretty smoothly.  He's been in plenty of Finals and has played well.  No matter what percentage he's at, I'm sure he'll be impactful and effective out there.","Player"
388,2019-06-09,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: I think after Game 4 it was a tough vibe in the locker room just because you lose two in a row at home.  Nobody likes that feeling at all, especially in The Finals, and it's kind of a little self-reflection of what do we need to do, what do we need to correct for us to stay alive.","Player"
389,2019-06-09,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: It definitely comes with experience, for sure, because you can say it, but just how hard it is to do that at this stage and at this level.  Having been here five straight times and been through all type of experiences and different styles of play, different paces, playing against amazing talents that we have had and even now with the way that Toronto has been playing these last two games, it's just a matter of buckling down and figuring it out.","Player"
390,2019-06-09,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: Yeah, considering how tough the last two games were, you can't lose your identity and certain things that have made us successful over the course of this run.  I don't think we need to reinvent the wheel by any stretch -- these huge adjustments or anything.  Looking at Games 3 and 4, where we lost them were these four- to six-minute mini-runs that Toronto went on, where they put a lot of pressure on us by just how efficient they have been on the offensive end, and felt like they could get any shot that they wanted to.  And obviously the way that they're defending us, just trying to create good offense on those possessions to kind of go back at them.  We haven't done it.  So that's really it.","Player"
391,2019-06-09,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: Mostly just defensively in terms of the stuff that they have done to create good looks on the offensive end, whether it's communication on our switches or rotations out of traps or simple details.  Just boxing out when a shot goes up.  Those are valuable possessions in a pivotal game like a Game 5 when you're down 3-1.  So we just have to have everybody in the same mindset, on the same page.  Just the mental focus you need to have.  It starts in practice, again, envisioning what that's going to look like, everybody marinating on it for the next 24 hours and then going out and getting the job done.","Player"
392,2019-06-09,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DeMARCUS COUSINS: Just got to play better than we have in the past.  Got to believe every game and see what happens","Player"
393,2019-06-09,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DeMARCUS COUSINS: It's a little weird to be the underdog now, but we'll roll with the punches and we'll come out playing as hard as we can and see what happens","Player"
394,2019-06-09,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DeMARCUS COUSINS: It is.  They're a tough team, they got five threats on the floor, they share the ball, they make everyone a threat and they do it really well.  So we got to come out on our toes ready to go","Player"
395,2019-06-09,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DeMARCUS COUSINS: These are the cards I was dealt, so just make the best of the situation, that's all you really can do","Player"
396,2019-06-09,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DeMARCUS COUSINS: Come out ready to play.  Every game from this point on is a Game 7, so that's how we'll approach it","Player"
397,2019-06-09,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DeMARCUS COUSINS: Focus.  Focused. That's it","Player"
398,2019-06-09,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DeMARCUS COUSINS: Absolutely","Player"

402,2019-06-07,"Nick Nurse","Postgame","Golden State Win","NICK NURSE: Well, we had a big problem with the third quarter in Game 2, so we had to make some adjustment there to try to combat the way they come out of the half.  They have been historically really good at that.  We made the decision to put Fred in in Game 3 and then Game 4 again tonight.","Coach"
403,2019-06-07,"Nick Nurse","Postgame","Golden State Win","NICK NURSE: Yeah, you know, once he gets into the series, which he did in Game 3, with the blocked shots and the rebounding and stuff, he seems to stay in the series.  He was great tonight, man, and it's kind of all -- he usually gives you all of it.  Once he starts blocking a couple shots and the offense comes and the rebounding comes and a putback here and there, and even his jump shot seems to come once he gets into the game defensively with a blocked shot or two","Coach"
404,2019-06-07,"Nick Nurse","Postgame","Golden State Win","NICK NURSE: Yeah, it's awesome, first of all, right.  I think we travel, our fans travel really well in the regular season.  We get this a lot on the road.  It's really amazing.  It's Canada's team, and Canadians from all over the country are traveling down and making plans when we play in Florida or California or any of the -- Detroit especially.  You ought to see a Detroit game.  It's really something in there, both teams' fans really get going.","Coach"
405,2019-06-07,"Nick Nurse","Postgame","Golden State Win","NICK NURSE: I wouldn't say that at all.  I'm just -- listen, I think that we have to go out there.  We don't know who is available, who is playing, and we have taken the stance of just whoever's out there we got to figure it out.  And we try to change the who is guarding who a little bit here and there, just because there's so many different guys in and out, they start somebody different every night it seems like.","Coach"
406,2019-06-07,"Nick Nurse","Postgame","Golden State Win","NICK NURSE: Yeah, I don't remember much about those guys other than they were really good and -- I don't know, I'm not very good at comparing teams or players from years gone by.","Coach"
407,2019-06-07,"Nick Nurse","Postgame","Golden State Win","NICK NURSE: He obviously -- he was kind of -- his game was kind of typical of the game, right, he was getting doubled early, which was an adjustment by them, and then they were also taking the easy -- well, the quick pass back right out where it came from, they were doubling and then denying Kyle, and we weren't doing a very good job of giving him an outlet.","Coach"
408,2019-06-07,"Nick Nurse","Postgame","Golden State Win","NICK NURSE: Well, obviously he's playing great and he's lifted us a lot of times with big buckets or runs of buckets or just that settling bucket when the place is going crazy and he'll calmly sink one to kind of quiet the crowd.","Coach"
409,2019-06-07,"Nick Nurse","Postgame","Golden State Win","NICK NURSE: Yeah, I mean, I think it's difficult.  I mean, we're going to get back there, and as you know, they're going to be going crazy in Toronto, and my message to them is, is we have never really talked about the series score, can't let people take you someplace you aren't yet, right, and we know this is a great team and we know how hard we have to play to beat them.  Home or away, we know how hard we have to play and just focus in on trying to be the hardest working team on the floor.  If we do that, then we'll give ourselves a chance to win and go from there.","Coach"
410,2019-06-07,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: Well, I think that the overall defense, what they shoot percentage-wise and how we rebound the ball percentage-wise is really all we're concerned about on a team level.  And that was going okay.  I thought one of the things our guys did a lot better I thought was shot contest.  Everybody.  When -- I don't know, an example, Jerebko was open, we ran out hard and contested him, or Iguodala was open, we ran out and challenged.","Coach"
411,2019-06-07,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: I just -- a couple things.  When you grow up coaching in the minor leagues or other leagues like this, especially the minor leagues, you don't know who is playing until about an hour before every game, sometimes 10 minutes before.  So you get used to just not really letting that hit your radar very much.","Coach"
412,2019-06-07,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: Yeah, maybe.  I think that more than anything, though, we always use the term just keep playing, right?  I think each game things can change dramatically.  Just because, I don't knows, somebody gets 29 in Game 1 of a series doesn't mean they're going to average 29 for the series.  You may not see that again.  Or just because a guy goes 11-8 or 0-7 or something doesn't mean he's not going to make his next one or have a good 4-6 game the next night.","Coach"
413,2019-06-07,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: Yeah, 1-11, and I didn't even know it because that was the game Kyle fouled out with six to go that went to double overtime, and I thought he played so great, I was in there singing his praises in the press conference, and someone said, you know, he was 1-11, and I said no, I didn't know because he was running hard and making plays.  And I think just keep playing.  Some nights the ball is going in, some nights it isn't.  But just impact the game with anyway you can, not just with your shooting or your scoring","Coach"
414,2019-06-07,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: Yeah, he's really talented.  It's really cool.  I think he's really, really talented as an artist in a number of paintings, sculptor, everything.  I've been to one of his shows, and he had a lot on display.","Coach"
415,2019-06-07,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: Well, most of the time I'm pretty happy with our effort.  I think if the games that we come and play really hard, you come out of the game and you say, man, the Raptors played hard tonight, then that's always a great starting point.  When we do that, our defense is usually pretty good.  And then I always think that jump starts our offense as well.","Coach"
416,2019-06-07,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: Well, I thought about it a little bit throughout the year.  I think just gives us a different look.  You know the look.  We played Kyle and Fred together a lot, and it gives us kind of a double push, two guys that can push it up the floor, two guys that can take it off the bounce, two guys that can run the team.  And mostly it helps Kyle get off the ball and get up the floor and Fred can get us into stuff.","Coach"
417,2019-06-07,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: That's probably up for you guys to decide.  Again, whether we're up 2-1 or down 2-1, like we have been in other series, or down 2-0 or blah, blah, blah, we're not really -- we haven't really talked about the score of the series at all the entire playoffs.  We have tried to just isolate every game.","Coach"
418,2019-06-07,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: I don't think there's been a switch that's been flipped or anything.  I thought we flipped a switch about Game 2 against Orlando.  We played really poorly in Game 1 to open the playoffs, and then from then on we have played a lot better defense, a lot harder, with a lot more connection.","Coach"
419,2019-06-07,"Kyle Lowry","Postgame","Golden State Win","KYLE LOWRY: I've been saying this all year, he's my best friend.  I talk to him almost every day.  It's not about basketball, it's about life.","Player"

They're the defending champs, and they're not going to go out easy.  They're going to come and fight and prepare to play the next game, and that's how we're preparing ourselves, that we have to -- we got to prepare ourselves to play the next game.  We haven't done anything yet","Player"
425,2019-06-07,"Kyle Lowry","Postgame","Golden State Win","SERGE IBAKA: Man, I was just trying to play basketball out there, and we know they would try to take Kawhi away, double him.  So I just tried to play in the space.  And also Kawhi and Kyle, all the guys, they did a great job to find me every time I was moving","Player"
426,2019-06-07,"Kyle Lowry","Postgame","Golden State Win","KYLE LOWRY: They're a really good third quarter team, and Kawhi came out and made two back-to-back threes and kind of got us jump started a little bit.  We know what happened in Game 2, and we know that was a big part of what we -- our learning process.  And every game is going to be different, but we just continued to just keep trying to stay in the moment, stay level-headed, stay with the game plan and understanding what we have to do and keep working","Player"
427,2019-06-07,"Kyle Lowry","Postgame","Golden State Win","KYLE LOWRY: I think I've said it in many ways, and I think he's really been -- his demeanor has kind of taken a big part of our team.  And we have some guys that are fiery and feisty, but we all kind of just stay level headed and never get too up, never get too down.","Player"
428,2019-06-07,"Kyle Lowry","Postgame","Golden State Win","SERGE IBAKA: Oh, man, just hard work.  We put a lot of work and we believe in us, but one of the good things about us is our toughness, mind toughness.  We be getting better and better each round, first round, second round, third round, and now we are here.","Player"
429,2019-06-07,"Kyle Lowry","Postgame","Golden State Win","KYLE LOWRY: He doesn't say anything, I don't think -- I think Serge is -- when Serge is effective defensively is when he's at his best.  I think the scoring just comes.  We're going to make sure he gets that pick-and-pop jump shot, he's rolling.","Player"
430,2019-06-07,"Kyle Lowry","Postgame","Golden State Win","SERGE IBAKA: We just try to stay together.  We try to stay together at that moment.  There's nothing we can do.  We're just hoping that he can come back and help us.","Player"
431,2019-06-07,"Kawhi Leonard","Postgame","Golden State Win","KAWHI LEONARD: Yeah, for sure.  You do your warm up, get treatment before the game, off days after the game, whatever, that can help speed your recovery up so you're able to play the next day","Player"
432,2019-06-07,"Kawhi Leonard","Postgame","Golden State Win","KAWHI LEONARD: We're playing two different teams, and I think we're a lot younger, we can switch pretty much if Serge is in the lineup 1 through 5 and, I don't know, I mean, it's hard to say.  I got to watch film and see what I see.","Player"
433,2019-06-07,"Kawhi Leonard","Postgame","Golden State Win","KAWHI LEONARD: Yeah, I mean, at the same time I knew I had faith that it was going to turn around for us.  We were missing a lot of wide-open shots.  Obviously I was getting to my spots and shooting the ball, but like you said, as the quarter went on towards, the last four, five minutes, I tried to stay as aggressive as possible, get to my spots, be confident, shoot the basketball.  And within that first quarter, I still was passing the ball.  I wanted my teammates to stay in a rhythm and know that I'm going to give them the ball when they're open","Player"
434,2019-06-07,"Kawhi Leonard","Postgame","Golden State Win","KAWHI LEONARD: It's not over yet, so I can't say that we're better.  Just the key to tonight's win was pretty much, as you guys know, playing defense.  And towards that second half we started to make some shots, and we just pretty much stuck into the game, stayed in the game","Player"
435,2019-06-07,"Kawhi Leonard","Postgame","Golden State Win","KAWHI LEONARD: I pretty much just said it, our defense and willing to stay in the game, have faith, not put our head down, knowing that we're going to make shots.  And that's pretty much what happened tonight","Player"
436,2019-06-07,"Kawhi Leonard","Postgame","Golden State Win","KAWHI LEONARD: Nothing, really.  We were confident.  We're on the road, down four, we wanted to come in and have a good third quarter coming out the first five minutes, stay aggressive on both end of the floor, keep our energy up.  And that's all we did","Player"
437,2019-06-07,"Kawhi Leonard","Postgame","Golden State Win","KAWHI LEONARD: Obviously just stay focused on Klay and Steph, just try and make sure they don't get in too good of a rhythm.  They're great players, just try to make sure we contest them as much as possible.","Player"
438,2019-06-07,"Kawhi Leonard","Postgame","Golden State Win","KAWHI LEONARD: You just got to be patient with it.  Not really.  We were two games away, four games away, it doesn't matter until you get that fourth win.  We just have to stay confident in ourselves, be patient, don't try to rush things, and see how it plays out","Player"
439,2019-06-07,"Kawhi Leonard","Postgame","Golden State Win","KAWHI LEONARD: You're saying was I surprised they didn't switch more and not double?  No, I thought we played well on the switches.  They put the bigs on the guards, and we attacked and made passes and we made shots or drove and found somebody under the rim.","Player"
440,2019-06-07,"Kawhi Leonard","Postgame","Golden State Win","KAWHI LEONARD: I mean, just like just going through the season, having our ups and downs, our experiences as a team, having bad streaks of losing or winning, just within our huddle.  We just take those experiences and keep moving and learn from them and just all talk to each other, really, and just keep our mindset on one goal","Player"
441,2019-06-07,"Kawhi Leonard","Postgame","Golden State Win","KAWHI LEONARD: I'm really not sure.  I guess you really would have to ask somebody on the street or one of our fans.  I'm pretty sure it's a long time waiting.  They're going to be excited.  I mean, they're already excited just as us just being here for the first time.  They're going crazy after the Eastern Conference Finals and -- I don't know, there's no telling.  You got to ask probably, like I said, a fan or somebody that's in Canada, been living in Canada for a while.  But I know they're going to be super excited.  I don't know.  We'll see.","Player"
442,2019-06-07,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Golden State Win","STEVE KERR: I thought they just took it to us right from the beginning of the quarter.  Kawhi hit two threes immediately and they turned up their defense, and they just got on a run.  And we just sort of lost that defensive tenacity that we had in the first half","Coach"
443,2019-06-07,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Golden State Win","STEVE KERR: You just try to win one game.  That's what we did a few years ago against OKC.  Win one game, and then you move forward.","Coach"
444,2019-06-07,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Golden State Win","STEVE KERR: He just got it going, and they did a good job in the second half of moving the ball and finding the open man.  They hit eight threes in the second half after we did a good job on them in the first, and so the ball started moving and they found Serge in the pockets and in the middle of the paint several times, and he had a great game","Coach"
445,2019-06-07,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Golden State Win","STEVE KERR: We're playing a really good team that moves the ball.  And I think we have had our moments defensively, but we haven't been able to string together the stops over the course of a game that we have needed to.","Coach"
446,2019-06-07,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Golden State Win","STEVE KERR: Well, we'll take a look at the tape, but we have been playing a certain style for a long time here.  And the ball moves, and Steph as one of the great off-ball cutters in the league and can play on and off the ball.  And so we're trying to mix up the different things that we do.  And it wasn't his best game, but he'll bounce back","Coach"
447,2019-06-07,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Golden State Win","STEVE KERR: I don't think it's daunting at all.  We go to Toronto, and this is what we do for a living, we play basketball.  So we look forward to playing another basketball game in an exciting atmosphere, and the ultimate test, NBA Finals.  So I think we look at it as a challenge.","Coach"
448,2019-06-07,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Golden State Win","STEVE KERR: Klay was amazing, with a tweaked hamstring to do what he did.  Looney as well, coming in and playing 20 minutes given his injury status.","Coach"
449,2019-06-07,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Golden State Win","STEVE KERR: Yeah, I think the turnovers hurt us.  Yeah, we probably played well enough in the first half to be up eight or ten, but that's not abnormal in the NBA.  They stayed in the game with their free throws in the first half.  I think they made ten to our two, and that kept it close while they were struggling offensively.","Coach"
450,2019-06-07,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Golden State Win","STEVE KERR: We go to Toronto and we try to win a game.  That's -- it's as simple as that.  So we're not thinking about winning three games, we're thinking about winning one game and that's the task.","Coach"
451,2019-06-07,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Golden State Win","STEVE KERR: Oh, Draymond played -- he played so hard tonight out there.  The first half the intensity level was incredible.  Just to see the athleticism and the defensive energy by both teams.  It was amazing.  Draymond's always right at the center of all that.  One of the best defenders I've ever seen, and he's flying around and doing his thing and covering everybody, and then offensively handling the ball and trying to distribute the ball to our shooters.","Coach"
452,2019-06-07,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: Kevon's going to give it a go tonight.  So further evaluation, a second opinion, and then a lot of research and making sure that there's no long-term risk involved with him playing.  And it all checked out, and he's dying to play, and so we'll give him a shot and we'll see what he's got","Coach"
453,2019-06-07,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: The guy's just tough.  He's tough and he wants to play.  And the injury is in an area where it allows him to move well enough to give it a shot to play","Coach"
454,2019-06-07,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: I don't believe so.  I'm not very good at these medical updates in case you couldn't tell.  So I think I'm going to change course here and I'll answer what I can.  But I'm -- again, I'm not good at it.  So I'll tell you what I can, and if I can't tell you anything good, I'm just going to say let's move on","Coach"
455,2019-06-07,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: He's not playing tonight.  We're hoping he can play Game 5 or 6.  And everything in between I've decided I'm not sharing because it's just gone haywire.  There's so much going on, and so it doesn't make sense to continue to talk about it.  He's either going to play or he's not.  So tonight he's not playing","Coach"
456,2019-06-07,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: Yes.  I'm getting better, Raymond","Coach"
457,2019-06-07,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: The mindset is let's make sure there's two more games here","Coach"
458,2019-06-07,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: Play harder.  Play better defense.  Our defense stunk the other night.  We got to play better tonight","Coach"
459,2019-06-07,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: Well, we love Al.  He's the face of the franchise.  He's been so for 60 years, I think.  So he's an incredible presence, and we're thrilled to have him back in the building.  It's been awhile since he's been at Oracle.  So we're excited to have him here","Coach"
460,2019-06-07,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: I'm comfortable with the fact that the training staff is comfortable with him giving it a shot","Coach"

462,2019-06-07,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: We actually see it a lot.  In the modern NBA, you see plenty of teams who put five shooters on the floor.  So it's nothing foreign.","Coach"
463,2019-06-07,"Draymond Green","Postgame","Golden State Win","DRAYMOND GREEN: That's important to have that pride, to have the faith in what we're capable of.  We just got to take it one game at a time.  We got to win one game.  We win one, then we'll build on that.  But I've been on the wrong side of 3-1 before, so why not make our own history","Player"
464,2019-06-07,"Draymond Green","Postgame","Golden State Win","DRAYMOND GREEN: I think they made shots.  Our defense was flying around.  I think we still got some good contests there in the second half, like started the half, they had two great contests on Kawhi's threes and he hit them.  Then they found a rhythm, and once a team like that finds a rhythm, it's hard to take them out of it","Player"
465,2019-06-07,"Draymond Green","Postgame","Golden State Win","DRAYMOND GREEN: Their ball movement has been great, I think our rotations tonight was better, but you know, still got to get better","Player"
466,2019-06-07,"Draymond Green","Postgame","Golden State Win","DRAYMOND GREEN: I don't think you're ever going to rattle Kawhi.  Not sure we used that word one time in our scouting report, we're going to rattle him.  But you just try to make him take tough shots, and you live with the results.","Player"
467,2019-06-07,"Draymond Green","Postgame","Golden State Win","DRAYMOND GREEN: Well, I think we kind of messed up our coverages a little bit on him, but you got to give him credit, he knocked some shots down.  Seems like every game it's somebody else.  You know, Danny Green in Game 3, then we completely take him out of the game tonight, and Serge, and so -- like I said, we got to win one game, and however we got to get that done, start with that and go from there","Player"
468,2019-06-07,"Draymond Green","Postgame","Golden State Win","DRAYMOND GREEN: I mean, just he kind of got a head start on me.  I was turning and sprinting, but just tried to make a play on the ball and was able to get the block and then knock the rebound away from Siakam, and we was going back the other way.  We still lost, though.  So it really don't matter","Player"
469,2019-06-07,"Draymond Green","Postgame","Golden State Win","DRAYMOND GREEN: He still don't look like them, but he's still getting it done.  You got to give him his credit.  He imposed his will on the game, and all the other guys followed him.  So I'm not sure if it will ever look like those other guys, but he gets the job done, so you got to give him credit for it","Player"
470,2019-06-07,"Draymond Green","Postgame","Golden State Win","DRAYMOND GREEN: Oh, this sucks.  It sucks really bad.  You just try and do whatever you can to change it.  Get a stop, get a bucket, get some momentum.  Every time we did, they answered.  So yeah, it sucked, a lot.  But can't get it back now","Player"
471,2019-06-07,"Draymond Green","Postgame","Golden State Win","DRAYMOND GREEN: Just keep guys' head up, keep guys' blitz defense up.  You got to win three games in a row.  We have won three games in a row before.  However you got to get that done, you just got to get it done.","Player"
472,2019-06-07,"Stephen Curry","Postgame","Golden State Win","STEPHEN CURRY: I mean, he played amazing.  He hit every big shot, momentum shot that in that third quarter, it gave them the lead.  And then kept the separation.","Player"
473,2019-06-07,"Stephen Curry","Postgame","Golden State Win","KLAY THOMPSON: I think it's just based on the NBA Finals and the chance to be at this stage and compete.  A lot of guys are banged up, probably on both sides, both teams, and it's just such a special opportunity, you just never know when it will ever come back again.","Player"
474,2019-06-07,"Stephen Curry","Postgame","Golden State Win","STEPHEN CURRY: Definitely he makes our entire team better.  He showed that tonight obviously with the injury like that and to come back playing aggressive, hitting big shots and giving us a chance to even be in the game.  So obviously he's a gamer and you love to go to war with guys like that.  We have been doing it for a long time","Player"
475,2019-06-07,"Stephen Curry","Postgame","Golden State Win","STEPHEN CURRY: That it's not over.  It's not a good feeling right now, obviously, but like you said, we have been on both sides of it.  And for us it's an opportunity for us to just flip this whole series on its head, and you got to do it one game at a time.  It sounds clich√©, and for us that's literally the only way we're going to get back in this series, is give everything we got for 48 minutes, everybody that sets foot on that floor in Game 5.","Player"
476,2019-06-07,"Stephen Curry","Postgame","Golden State Win","STEPHEN CURRY: I mean, not really, they have been aggressive all series and trying to take space away from me and Klay.  I missed some shots early that I usually make, especially from the three-point line, but overall I feel like I got good looks, and obviously I'm sure they were a little bit more focused on us two, considering how Game 3 went and having a great game plan.","Player"
477,2019-06-07,"Stephen Curry","Postgame","Golden State Win","KLAY THOMPSON: It didn't affect me.  Like I said before, it's the Finals, it's a long season, you play a hundred-plus games, you're going to be banged up.  But you just got to dig deep.  No one's going to feel sorry for you, so you just got to go out there, man up and play the best of your ability","Player"
478,2019-06-07,"Stephen Curry","Postgame","Golden State Win","STEPHEN CURRY: Not really, we try to win every game we play.  We don't -- you don't succeed the way we have over the course of these years without that mentality.  So as the second half unfolds and things aren't going our way, we're still fighting and trying to get over the hump.  But until the final buzzer sounds and somebody gets the four wins, we still have life and have an opportunity to win.","Player"
479,2019-06-07,"Stephen Curry","Postgame","Golden State Win","KLAY THOMPSON: They're a good -- they're a great team and it's the NBA Finals.  They got a lot of, everyone knows their role.  They got a lot of experience, guys who have been here before.  And hopefully Game 5 we have bigger runs and they can't close the gap.  But it's just basketball.  You got to give them credit.","Player"
480,2019-06-06,"Fred VanVleet","Practice","N/A","FRED VANVLEET: I think it started last year for the playoffs, just really learning the margins of error and how mentally locked in and just the excellence it takes to win in the postseason.  One possession can change a series, and with those type of stakes it takes a different level of mental focus and physical performance.","Player"
481,2019-06-06,"Fred VanVleet","Practice","N/A","FRED VANVLEET: Yeah, we haven't got ahead of ourselves the whole year.  We haven't gotten ahead of ourselves in the playoffs, and it's not going to start now.  We're up 2-1 and we're on the road and we just want to try to get another win.  We're not thinking about the rest of the series.  We're thinking about Game 4, trying to get a win against the defending champs","Player"
482,2019-06-06,"Fred VanVleet","Practice","N/A","FRED VANVLEET: It's disappointing.  It's very disappointing that that's where we are in our game.  It's just funny because I literally just watched the Ron Artest show on Showtime a few days ago.  They did a great job with describing that stuff.  Ron and Ben had their thing, but it really started from a guy who threw a cup, right?  You can't have that.  You can't have that in a game.  It sucks that we have to take the high road all the time, but that is what it is.  It's unfortunate that some people feel like they can do things like that.","Player"
483,2019-06-06,"Fred VanVleet","Practice","N/A","FRED VANVLEET: If he had a billion dollars or zero dollars, there's no room for that in our game.  We have a great game and we have to protect that.  I know what the consequences will be if it was a player doing that to a fan.  So we hope that we see that reciprocated on the other end","Player"
484,2019-06-06,"Fred VanVleet","Practice","N/A","FRED VANVLEET: Yeah, there should be some type of bonus or something when you don't react.  Kyle should get some type of bonus for not doing what every human wants to do in that situation.","Player"
485,2019-06-06,"Klay Thompson","Practice","N/A","KLAY THOMPSON: Well, let's try the first part.  Just a lot of time on the training table, a lot of time in the cold tub, acupuncture.  Just the basic remedies to get you ready for a NBA athlete.  So a lot of that.  It's a different type of grind, but I embrace it and it's fun.","Player"

We have been in this position before, so we can rely on our experience and we're getting guys back.  It just sucks missing a Finals game.  It's the NBA Finals and this is what we work our whole lives for.  But at the end of the day, I would rather miss one game than an entire series.  So it wasn't the end of the world","Player"
489,2019-06-06,"Klay Thompson","Practice","N/A","KLAY THOMPSON: It's a lot more anxiety than playing because you can't really control anything.  It's all out of your hands and all you can do is really support your teammates and be the best teammate you can be, try to be that.  Give","Player"

I still think we would have a good chance to win The Finals, but obviously that takes a huge hit.  I don't think it would make us the clear-cut favorite anymore without him.  This team is very good","Player"
491,2019-06-06,"Klay Thompson","Practice","N/A","KLAY THOMPSON: Yeah, I just being able to guard their guards out there.  They looked comfortable yesterday.  They were playing in great rhythm.  So it makes you mad.  You want to get out there and stop them.  I'll try and do that tomorrow","Player"
492,2019-06-06,"Klay Thompson","Practice","N/A","KLAY THOMPSON: It definitely helps.  It's a different team, obviously, and different scenario being at home and then having to go win one on the road.  But it definitely helps knowing we have done it before","Player"

497,2019-06-06,"Klay Thompson","Practice","N/A","KLAY THOMPSON: A hundred percent.  If I hadn't been here before, knowing that we could do this in this position, it would have been very hard.

507,2019-06-06,"Pascal Siakam","Practice","N/A","PASCAL SIAKAM: Yeah, definitely he was my favorite player right there.  I looked at it and it was high and, yeah, when it dropped it was definitely crazy.  That was a good shot.","Player"
508,2019-06-06,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: Yeah, I was, and she obviously was -- passed away during the season in our West Coast road trip.  She didn't live long enough to see me get the head coaching job, and it was a huge, huge part of -- I mean, like any mom, right, she went to every game I played when I was younger and when I played in college.  My senior year my dad retired early so they could go to every single game, home and away.  Put a lot of miles on the car and all that kind of stuff.  But they were big fans.","Coach"
509,2019-06-06,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: Well, we didn't know.  We had him on the board as a starter when we left the locker room.  Because he was active, right?  We just -- it wasn't like we were trying to exploit anything, we're just trying to play with some pace and some space and hit the open man a little better.","Coach"
510,2019-06-06,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: He's a great defender.  I think he's one of the best, right up there at the top of the best wing defenders in the league.  I mean, he's probably underrated in that department.  He really puts in some awesome defensive performances for them, especially when they really need them.  So probably helped us","Coach"
511,2019-06-06,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: Yeah, I mean, listen, I don't really care.  I don't really give a crap, is my line.  Like, I mean, if things work, I don't care if I go out there and four guys stand on their head and we get a stop, right?  And it was very effective.  The only basket they got against it was a three-pointer by Iguodala with eight seconds to go or something like that","Coach"
512,2019-06-06,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: Yeah, I think that's the way you got to be.  There's a lot of scenarios now, maybe more than in the past, I mean, we had a lot of games where we were missing our key guys this year.  I think Kawhi missed 20-some, Kyle missed 20-some.  We played against a lot of teams where guys were in and out.  It's happening, so you just -- I don't know, you can't really let it affect you.  You got to go play the game no matter who is out there.  And at this time of year, everybody's going to play really hard and everybody's got good players, so I'm glad that we didn't let it affect us.  It's critical, games are critical right now","Coach"
513,2019-06-06,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: He had 47 points.  I don't know if we did, had enough attention on him or we had anything going on him, to be honest with you.  But I was happy with -- more with we just wanted to play more solid defense, and that for us means getting it set up, getting some pressure on the ball, contesting shots of all players, right?  You know, that, to me, I thought our shot contests were great all the way across the board.  That was a big key","Coach"
514,2019-06-06,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: Well, the -- there's never a plan like X amount of shots, a specific plan, right, you guys have heard me say I would like Kyle to take 10 threes every night.  But the plan is is that you attack them.  When you draw multiple defenders, do your best to get off it, because you've done your job if you're drawing multiple, two guys or three guys, you've really done your job, and hit the open man and play from there.","Coach"
515,2019-06-06,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: Yeah, he has taken the opportunities that are there, and he got some last night, especially in transition.  He's a really, really good shooter.  When he vaults up from three with space, you're pretty surprised when it doesn't go in because he's got great mechanics, he's usually got it on line.  When he doesn't make them, he sometimes gets a little flat.  But usually when he vaults up from three with good room, some space between him, you feel pretty good about that, and he got some of those last night","Coach"
516,2019-06-06,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: Maybe, but not really trying to think about that.  Again, like to me this is a one-game series tomorrow.  We're just trying to take them like each game's critical.  We need to put a huge effort in because I think if we put a huge effort in and we're the hardest playing team, then we're going to deserve to win.  And that's all we're focused on.","Coach"
517,2019-06-06,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: Thank you.","Coach"
518,2019-06-06,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: First of all, I want to thank the Warriors for the statement they issued, and then the NBA also.  It's just what our league's about and protecting the players.","Player"
519,2019-06-06,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: Yeah.  Multiple times","Player"
520,2019-06-06,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: Understanding that at the moment my team needed me.  Understanding that there are plenty of fans and kids in the world watching this game.  Me being a grown man, having kids myself.  I'm a grown man and my kids could always go back and see that.","Player"
521,2019-06-06,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: Yeah, not everyone, not all of them.  But certain ones, yes.  And I can say for sure that guy makes me feel like that.  Mark Stevens, whoever his name is, makes me feel like he's one of those guys.  Draymond with that, I remember him saying that.  I believe it's true.  We call it the Board of Governors, but people in the world would call it the ownership.  It should be changed.  And a guy like that definitely shows that's what he feels, to me","Player"
522,2019-06-06,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: Whatever happened, happened.  I mean, I was furious.  I'm not going to lie.  It took me a couple minutes to kind of -- I think it was a foul.  The ball came in play.  I was still thinking about it, and the foul was called.  I believe we called a timeout.  I was pretty upset.  Marc Gasol kind of came to me and said, Look, come on, we need you, kind of come back; they will handle it.  And Freddie and Kawhi and those guys, Danny, kind of like, Try to come back here, we need you to stay in this moment and understand the situation that we were in as a basketball game.","Player"
523,2019-06-06,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: We have to go out there and do our job.  We have to continue to be better as a basketball group.  We watched film this morning, and we found a lot of mistakes that we made.  I think we have to continue to just stay in the moment, continue to push the pace and continue to play defense the way we know how to play defense and do what we can do and control what we can control","Player"
524,2019-06-06,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: The one thing about Bron, he's always been an activist and he's always been unbelievable with this.  I sent the text, a message to him.  He sent one back.  I thanked him because he's one of the biggest athletes and most vocal guys that we have out there. His social activism has been amazing.  And he sticks up for his fellow players.","Player"
525,2019-06-06,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","He always does the right thing.  That's the one thing about him: He's been doing the right thing his whole career.  And it means a lot.  It really does.  It means a lot to be able to have the support of a guy like him and other players also reaching out and having support.","Player"
526,2019-06-06,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: No","Player"
527,2019-06-06,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: No, I don't think there's any -- I don't know him.  I don't care to know him.  He showed his true colors at the time.  And you show what you're really about in that time and at that moment.  And it's not, oh, you get the reaction of everyone else saying this, that, and the other, that's kind of the whole -- I mean, no, you showed what you really are.","Player"
528,2019-06-06,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","For me, if that happened to me:  Hey, you okay?  You good?  And move on.  But at that moment, in the heat of the moment, when the pressure and the tightness is on you, you show who you really are","Player"
529,2019-06-06,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: Unbelievable.  Even worse.  Even worse.  He should understand this is what happens.  This is basketball.  I'm competing.  I'm trying to save a basketball.  I'm trying to help my team get a possession.  It just sucks, man.  It just sucks that you got people like that","Player"
530,2019-06-06,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: I think what I think and what I feel is a guy like that shouldn't be a part of our league.  Being honest with you.  That's my personal opinion.  That's just how I feel.  We have had situations like this before and the league has done the right thing. That's protecting the players and protecting the image of the league.","Player"
531,2019-06-06,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: Well, it takes an All-Star, All-NBA guy off the floor.  That's one.  It made Steph be a lot more aggressive and still having 47 points, doing everything he could possibly do to help his team win the game.","Player"
532,2019-06-06,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: I didn't see that.  I hit the ball.  I was trying to just dive and save it.  And, I mean, I made a good save.  It just happened to hit the official, Marc Davis, that was standing there.  He was standing out of bounds, so it was a good call by him, out of bounds","Player"
533,2019-06-06,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: For him to be gone.  At that moment, it should have been taken care of right away.  I understand this, and I love our fans.  We have great fans.  But for you to push me, to curse at me, to say things to me, that's not tolerable at all.  At that moment, I wanted it to be taken care of.  But we're discussing it now.  Hopefully things get taken care of.  I appreciate the Warriors again for their apology, the NBA for stepping up and we'll see what happens from there.","Player"
534,2019-06-06,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: Just our experience.  Our experience, our character, knowing we have been here before and just also just trusting each other.  We know what not to do, panic.  So just don't panic in this situation, and I think we'll be all right","Player"
535,2019-06-06,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: No, but meaning from the series standpoint, like again we got to keep our perspective and our focus on what we can control.  We can't control any of that.  So, no, we haven't been there before, but we have been down in a series, so we look at it from that standpoint, right?  We have been down.  Hopefully we get some guys back, and then it's just a game at a time","Player"
536,2019-06-06,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: Defense.  Defense.  We're not going to win with offense.  This is a really good team, and defensively we're going to have to do the job","Player"
537,2019-06-06,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: Yeah, guys going in and out, I mean, it's just part of the game.  It's definitely still a challenge because you're trying to find the right combinations, and then it's just -- it's tough.  And this team, they put a lot of pressure on you, the way that they play.","Player"
538,2019-06-06,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: Yeah, I mean, that's unfortunate because that's not how you want to be represented as an organization, as a team.  So I think the NBA, from what I understand, has suspended him indefinitely.  I think that's the right move because if we were in Toronto or any other arena, we would want that same protection for our guys, right?  So what's fair is fair at the end of the day.  What's right is right, what's wrong is wrong.  No matter who you are","Player"
539,2019-06-06,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: We expect them to come out rowdy.  We need them, we need them.  This is a game on our home court that we have to have, which we want to get, and we need that sixth man energy","Player"
540,2019-06-06,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: Obviously, I think they play a lot like us, the way that you look at their roster, the way it's built.  And I was just saying they put a lot of pressure on you.  They put guys in their spots, which creates confidence throughout the team because guys have chemistry, understanding of what each other does well, and then they do that.  So they expect that from each other.  So that builds trust.  It builds continuity.","Player"
541,2019-06-06,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: Yeah, they do, for sure.  I mean, in The Finals, I think this is definitely -- I think they're up there as the highest ","Player"
542,2019-06-06,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: A lot just what I was saying, just their feel, their understanding of each other, tendencies, through and through.  Then also just time, score, getting to the line, yeah all those things","Player"
543,2019-06-06,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: No, definitely should be a sense of urgency.  I mean, it's the NBA Finals so it's like every game should be a sense of urgency.  Now it's probably human nature to let your guard down after a win because you're feeling good about yourself.  It's just how it happens.  But we're at home and we expect to get this game","Player"
544,2019-06-06,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: By being Klay Thompson.  Just doing what he does on the offensive and defensive ends","Player"
545,2019-06-06,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: It's tough.  If we got a couple guys -- because, again, I think with Steph, what he does, right, it's unparalleled.  I think Klay is similar because, again, off defensive -- on the defensive side of the ball, he guards the best players on the perimeter, for the most part, and offensively he spaces the court out, great complement to Steph.  Draymond is irreplaceable for what he does, just from a team standpoint, defensively.","Player"
546,2019-06-06,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: Yeah, I mean, just from a feel standpoint maybe, but it's tough from a rotational standpoint, guys coming in at different times.  Yeah, it definitely throws a kink in it","Player"
547,2019-06-06,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: I don't really press those guys.  I'm more so -- just I'm in the wind.  I'm kind of in the wing for those guys if they need to talk.  I talked to Cous throughout the season, here and there, about my experience, my situation, and then just hopefully he can take something from that and apply it","Player"
548,2019-06-06,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: Yeah, definitely, I mean, the core group of guys that's been here, they understand what it takes, so it's kind of understanding, but from -- some of the other guys, younger guys, bench guys I'm talking to, just making sure their head is in the right, their mind is in the right space, and just try to help them be ready as possible","Player"
549,2019-06-06,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: Just staying poised and also knowing that the game is about mistakes.  Don't get too high, don't get too low","Player"
550,2019-06-06,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: Yeah, I did address it.  Just more so about what's fair is fair, right?  It sounded like the League's suspended him, and it seems to me it's the right move.  If one of our guys was in a different arena, we were up in Toronto and a fan did that, we would be calling for the same action, regardless if he was an owner or a fan just coming to the game for the first time.","Player"
551,2019-06-06,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: I think it's because of how the social media has taken off.  There's more media coverage throughout the games, there's more exposure to these type of incidents.  So there's more of a fan base.  There's more of a forum to talk about it.  So I think that's kind of what builds up the momentum when these things happen","Player"
552,2019-06-06,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: Yeah, not -- for the most part, no.  For the most part I think the League has done a great job throughout their arenas with the security of keeping everybody in check, keeping boundaries in place.  There have been incidents, there have been incidents where things have happened.  I think it's been handled the right way.  But any time something like that happens you have to address it, you have to face it, you have to address it right away.","Player"
553,2019-06-06,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: I mean, I've never been one of those guys that growing up in high school getting all the media and the college media, so I don't really think my legacy is going to ever reach the potentials of Michael Jordan and how the media followed them since they were a rookie.","Player"
554,2019-06-06,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: It really doesn't matter.  I didn't make a decision off the media or what people thought of me.  Like I said, I made it off my own personal views and what I seen and how I felt as a person to make myself happy","Player"
555,2019-06-06,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: Just wanting to do it, I guess.  Moving his feet, contesting shots, wanting to play defense. ","Player"
556,2019-06-06,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: Yeah, for sure.  Obviously the skill comes into play, like I said, having quick feet, able to read shots, contesting","Player"
557,2019-06-06,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: I mean, it's the same mindset.  If we didn't feel like we could be here, we wouldn't be here right now.  Simple as that.  I have the same confidence.  You can't let losses or wins affect that.  It's about what you think and feel that's in your body, your inner thoughts and you know what you portray to your team and what your team is telling you and what we all feel.  And that's why we are here, we have confidence","Player"
558,2019-06-06,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: I mean, it would be very important.  I mean, it would be a third win, and you need four to win.  You already know how important that is.  It's 3-1","Player"
559,2019-06-06,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: He's done a great job.  We're in The Finals his first year, I mean, what else could you expect or want from a first-year coach other than a championship?  I think he handled himself well.  I really don't know what people are portraying of him.  I don't read the media or see what you guys are saying about him, so -- but I think he's been doing a great job","Player"
560,2019-06-06,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: Just competitive nature.  He's able to change schemes quickly, adjust.  But it's tough to compare somebody that's been coaching for 20 years and this is his first year in the NBA, even though he coached, been a head coach in other levels.  So, I mean, it's just hard to compare that.  It's like a rookie, you compare him to a 15-year veteran, that's a Hall of Fame vet, you know","Player"
561,2019-06-06,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: I mean, it doesn't matter.  As long as we win, I don't even -- I didn't even know that.  Like I said, it's not about me.  I'm not here to play hero basketball.  If there's two or three guys on me, I'm going to make sure somebody gets the ball and they're going to knock down a shot.","Player"
562,2019-06-06,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: The league will figure that out.  Kyle handled it great.  He kept playing.  I think he told the referee what happened.  He probably thought about it five seconds and then got back to the game, which is important, not taking any possessions off reminiscing on what a fan did or an owner.","Player"
563,2019-06-06,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: So Klay will plan on playing tomorrow.  So we expect him to play, barring something unforeseen.  He's continued to improve and so that's good news.","Coach"
564,2019-06-06,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: It's not really about that, it's just about when the training staff tells me he's ready.  He's been doing individual work on the court, he's been in the training room, in the weight room.  He's been doing lots of different things, training staff said he's not ready to play in a game yet, so that's all","Coach"
565,2019-06-06,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: It's not going to happen today.  I think that's something that will happen in the coming days, but not today","Coach"
566,2019-06-06,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: Our defense was poor last night and in particular several times leaving Danny when we didn't need to and he's a shooter who commands attention and respect.  And there were at least three of his shots where we just drifted away from him, and we have got to stay connected to him","Coach"
567,2019-06-06,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: Well, there's no need for him to take the heat on a loss.  We lost the game as a team, and Draymond played hard, all our guys played hard.  I thought they competed their butts off, but we didn't play well enough to win.","Coach"
568,2019-06-06,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: Yeah, yeah, I do.  I think it's part of who he is.  He likes to motivate himself.  And so if he doesn't play well, he beats himself up a little bit and he sort of opens up about it to the media, and then he comes out and he plays better the next game","Coach"
569,2019-06-06,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: Combination of all that.  When you change the lineups and you're without some key guys, now you're ending up with five guys on the floor who generally haven't played together a whole lot.  And so I think that while the effort was there, the execution was not.","Coach"
570,2019-06-06,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: No","Coach"
571,2019-06-06,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: We're gathering information, a second opinion type thing, and so it's sort of open.  It's an open question, and as we gather information, we'll know more.  But at this point there's not really anything to report.  But we're -- we are looking at all of our options and his options","Coach"
572,2019-06-06,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: I have not seen the play.  I didn't see it last night.  I saw the commotion afterwards, but I haven't seen a replay and I didn't really even know the story until this morning.  I know our organization has put out a release, and I will let the release speak for itself.  It's really not my jurisdiction.  But I will also personally apologize to Kyle and to the Raptors.  That's unacceptable","Coach"
573,2019-06-06,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: Not really.  Last night is about the extent of what I think Steph is capable of.  He was brilliant, he was amazing, but I think he was -- I took him out with about two minutes left, and he got about two and a half minutes' rest in the second quarter.","Coach"
574,2019-06-06,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: Well, no, there was no setback.  So I was hoping that today would be the day when he could get out on the floor.  It's not going to be today.  It's going to be probably tomorrow, the following day, the next couple of days.","Coach"
575,2019-06-06,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: It just feels like business as usual, honestly.  I hope that doesn't sound arrogant, but the benefit of having been through five years of this is we have literally seen everything.  We have lost a 3-1 lead in a heartbreaking fashion.  We have come back from 3-1 down.  We have had to win a Game 7 on the road.  We have been without Steph Curry for a series.  We have been without Kevin Durant.  We were without Klay last night.  Our opponents have been without key players.  So you can name it and we have seen it.","Coach"
576,2019-06-06,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: It's not a -- that's not a thought that goes through my head.  That's for your stories.  A lot of different angles to take.  We're trying to do the best we can on Kawhi, on their team.  We have to make a lot of improvements defensively.  It was a very poor effort.","Coach"
577,2019-06-06,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: Thanks.","Coach"
578,2019-06-06,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: I think that the NBA will do a good job of really taking it sort of in the right focus and come up with the right decision.  Obviously I'm a player first-type guy no matter what, so don't ever want any player to -- I hope it gets handled the right way.  I'll leave it at that","Player"
579,2019-06-06,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: Well, the climate we're in now, no one is afraid to really express themselves, whether it be through their beliefs, whatever that is.  There are incentives to be brave with who you truly are","Player"
580,2019-06-06,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: Happy?  I wouldn't say happy","Player"
581,2019-06-06,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: Oh, it's good that they reacted in the manner to put out that message that we don't want to condone that and that's not acceptable","Player"
582,2019-06-06,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: Favorite moment from this arena?  That's a tough one.  That's a really good question.  First playoff series here was pretty exciting.  It was pretty good.  We hadn't priced out many people yet, so it was good","Player"
583,2019-06-06,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: No, I didn't even know that.  Yeah, I didn't know that one.  I think it was just one game at a time.  We just got in a good groove and things were in a very peaceful place back then, so it was good","Player"
584,2019-06-06,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: I don't know how to answer that.  I don't know","Player"
585,2019-06-06,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: I mean, he's a minority owner, so, yeah.  When an athlete makes a mistake, he's a representative of the league.  So, yeah, I would say so","Player"
586,2019-06-06,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: Not personally.  I may have met him.  We have a larger ownership group, so sometimes you meet one or two maybe once or twice and not as familiar with others","Player"
587,2019-06-06,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: I haven't.  It's so much noise right now around The Finals that it's hard to really see everything.  That's something I probably should have seen, but just had a lot going on already","Player"
588,2019-06-06,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: Our team it doesn't affect as much because it's like a 24-hour news cycle with our team outside of that.  So we're used to being able to deal with noise and come back on the court and try to focus on basketball","Player"
589,2019-06-06,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: For their sake, I hope it doesn't happen.  I mean, we have had incidents in Toronto already outside the arena.  I think we reacted in a calm manner.  So it will continue to happen, especially with gambling coming along","Player"
590,2019-06-06,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: I mean people aren't afraid to be who they are.  You just pay attention to the news","Player"
591,2019-06-06,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: Well, it's not like it was back then.  You couldn't be really brave back then.  It wasn't being brave; it was just get in line.","Player"
592,2019-06-06,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: No, that doesn't.  That doesn't affect what I can and can't say at all.  I've always been pro-player.  It's more so your words or your actions can affect the guys who go out there and you fight with every day on the court.  That's what you have to be cautious of.","Player"
593,2019-06-06,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: I tweeted it not too long ago.  Someone just hugged me in a hotel.  It was one of those situations where if it was the opposite, I would be in jail.  But that's happened","Player"
594,2019-06-06,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: I don't know.  It may or may not be.  We don't know the intentions or the reasons why.","Player"
595,2019-06-06,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: I think each game is different.  It's not really so much a momentum game to game, but we hope -- we would like to carry over.  If we could continue to shoot as good as we did would be great, but we have to do a better job defensively.","Player"
596,2019-06-06,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: We try to do a little of everything to keep the fans out.  We know how great this building is and can get once they get going.  So we try to limit their scoring, which will hopefully keep the crowd out of it, and hopefully increase our scoring.  And that helps win the games, obviously.  But if we can limit their runs as much as possible, it will keep the crowd out of it, and it will help us I think a ton","Player"
597,2019-06-06,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: So I heard","Player"
598,2019-06-06,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: He should know better, obviously.  I would say the punishment should be I guess more.  I don't know what it's going to be, but it should be more than what they would give an average fan because he should know better.","Player"
599,2019-06-06,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: I mean, it could.  It hasn't gotten that extreme.  Obviously there's been some player-fan interactions, and the League has done a good job of handling it.  I think the fans -- I don't think players are scared of the fans as much as you think.  As much as we try to protect ourselves, I think we're more so afraid of hurting people when we do dive into the stands.  But knowing we're going in there and hoping -- now hoping that it's safe to go in there and dive, knowing that sometimes you might get touched or hit, that doesn't seem -- or sit very comfortably with most players, or it doesn't seem right or fair to let the fans be able to react or jump on the court or be in a player's face and say certain things.  Because when we say it, we get fined or when we do something, we get in big trouble.  But the League is handling it.  I'm sure they will take care of it the best they see fit, and I don't think we're scared of the fans.  We're not worried about them","Player"
600,2019-06-06,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: I'm hoping that they do.  I have full faith in Adam Silver and our league and the Players Association to communicate with them to figure out a way to make sure things get taken care of the proper way.  If it doesn't, then I'm sure the players will take it upon themselves to find a way to use their voice to make some changes throughout this league regardless of the fact -- something has to be done, and if the NBA doesn't figure it out, I think the Players Association may take it into their own hands.  Or our team.  Who knows.  We might get a petition to pay the fines and pay us","Player"
601,2019-06-06,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: No, I've been in many games where fans are right on top of you, that makes the game fun, for the most part, especially in college.  But in this league the fans are on top of you, there have been some fans that have said some things out of line, out of pocket.  We say some things to a fan, if we cuss at a fan, like I said, we're going to be fined.","Player"
602,2019-06-06,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: No.  Being in San Antonio, we didn't have any incidents, we didn't have any with the fans or coaches or players.  Everything was pretty handled -- outside of the whole media frenzy of what happened with Kawhi's injury and stuff like that, the whole Zaza thing, a lot of fans were not happy in San Antonio about Zaza","Player"
603,2019-06-06,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: I think it's been awhile since I had some good quality -- I think we had great pace.  We had a couple different sets, a couple different actions, but we moved the ball well.  Guys took their time, they were very patient, and I think we were just all aggressive, coming out firing and not thinking about it, playing with an edge, with a chip, knowing we had to get that win last night.","Player"
604,2019-06-06,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: I was pretty -- very shocked, actually.  I mean, I was right there, I saw it, I saw him, I looked at him like -- my first thought was that this guy, if he's courtside, he's got to be somebody.  So if you're somebody or if you've been courtside before, you should definitely know the rules and regulations.","Player"
605,2019-06-06,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","Once again, he's an older gentleman, so I'm like:  What the hell are you doing?  You got to know better.  I think you probably have kids.  Like you don't teach your kids to react that way or act that way at the game.  So why would you do that?","Player"
606,2019-06-06,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: Okay.  I didn't know that.  I just saw K-Lo diving into the stands.  I guess she tried to catch the ball before K-Lo could actually get to it?  I didn't know that happened","Player"
607,2019-06-06,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: I think they try to move or at least allow the player, if the player is making a play at it, give him the opportunity to make a play at it.  Just like in baseball.  I mean, as a fan you get in trouble for reaching over for the home run or grabbing the ball when a guy has an opportunity to make a play at it.  So we got to give the player a chance to get there, and I think the best bet is just move out of the way if you possibly can","Player"
608,2019-06-06,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: I think it's game by game.  We haven't done anything yet.  I haven't done anything yet.  It's just one game.  It obviously helps to see one or two go in the basket.  The first one it helps build a rhythm, so hopefully next game I can hit the first one again and get a good look.  You know, Kyle found me in the corner.  It was a pretty good look.","Player"
609,2019-06-06,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: I think the human elements are important.  At the end of the day you want -- as much as you want to win, this is how people feed their family.  So as I've said before, when you have injuries, you live those injuries every day.  So obviously Steve, as a former player, he understands that.  And if Klay was to go out there and play last night and injure his hamstring, he'll be dealing with that for a long time.  Even when you hurt like hamstrings and stuff, like, yeah, you may be back healthy in four, six weeks or whatever, but you're still dealing with that.","Player"
610,2019-06-06,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: I think players are definitely vulnerable.  Any time you're in a situation where you can do no right, like in defending yourself, you're vulnerable.  So if a fan says whatever they want to you and then you say something back, you're fined.  If Kyle was to then hit back, a lot more than a fine would have then happened to Kyle.","Player"
611,2019-06-06,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: I mean, obviously this organization from the time I've been here and everything I've known about this organization has been a top-notch, upper-echelon organization.  So definitely not the type of thing that you want out of somebody out of the ownership group when you're talking about the organization.","Player"
612,2019-06-06,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: I think you have to be.  When you're speaking of players, we are held to a different standard.  Coaches are held to -- anybody in the NBA circle, you're held to a different standard.  So I think it's no different when you start talking of anybody in any ownership group in the league.  You're held to a different standard.  You can say it's unfair or not, like whatever your opinion is on it, whether you're one way or the other, that's just the reality of it.  We're all held to a different standard, and that's not going to change.","Player"
613,2019-06-06,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: I think he's just trying to get healthy.  I'm not really sure if he's been held out or he is -- I mean, obviously, I think he's still recovering and whatever, but, yeah, I don't really know what's Kevin's day-to-day dealings with the training staff.  I try to spend as less time in the training room as I can.  So I don't really know what their back and forth is","Player"
614,2019-06-06,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: I think having Klay back is important.  When you talk about missing Klay, Kevin and Kevon, obviously, everything will point to the offensive end, but they're three of our top five or six defenders, and I think that's equally or even more important than the offensive side of the ball.  Like we still scored, what, 109 points last night?  That's enough points to win.  We have won with 109.","Player"
615,2019-06-06,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: Well, he'll come back and draw a lot of attention because no coach is going to be like, oh, he's coming off injury, let's see if he's not quite Kevin Durant.  Like you're just not going to take that chance.  So it will open the floor up more, that's for sure.","Player"
616,2019-06-06,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: I think when you're hit with a little adversity, whether it's being down 2-1 or whether it's being down 17 or 12 or whatever it is, your true colors show.  I think that's just kind of the makeup of us, that's our DNA.  Our backs are against the wall, we continue to fight.  We have a lot of firepower.  So all of a sudden we continue to fight, and then we go on a run.  Some teams, they don't handle that situation well.","Player"
617,2019-06-06,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: Yeah, you could feel that the team was playing well, that we were in rhythm, we were helping one another, communicating, sharing the basketball, all the good things that happen in a team sport","Player"
618,2019-06-06,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: You want to win and you want to do whatever puts you closer to that ending.  So we understand our strength is the team and we have so much talent on the team and guys that can do multiple things but we got to do it as a unit","Player"
619,2019-06-06,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: It's very unfortunate that somebody feels that he needs to do that or that something inside like pushes him to act a certain way.  At the same time I look at the other, I don't know how many people fit here, how they behave at the same time.  Obviously it's a really bad example, but we can look at many other people how they're behaving and how nice they have been.  So obviously it's unfortunate, I'm sure it's going to be handled, but I also would rather look at the bright side and see how many other people are supportive and cheering and cheering for the team and booing us when they have to, but obviously it's not acceptable","Player"
620,2019-06-06,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: I think more than being the guy that's guarding me early on in the game it's me being aggressive, period.  So there's no conscious effort going at him, it's more me being aggressive myself.  So that's my mindset","Player"
621,2019-06-06,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: I would create more space on some of the actions, we did a little more movement on Game 3. I felt collectively we had a conscious effort of it, yeah","Player"
622,2019-06-06,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: No, no, I think that there's enough thinking heads right now analyzing and seeing what's the best for that.  But just always keep in mind the example that has been set for the younger generation, that it's not ideal to interact with a player that had just dove for a ball out of bounds.  I'm sure that it's going to be handled","Player"
623,2019-06-06,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: Yeah, I think the NBA has done a great job of -- that's why I'm allowing and not being -- I'm not even commenting on what should be the punishment, because I feel that they always have done what's best for the League and for the players.  Obviously it's what's best for the League is best for the players and the other way around.","Player"
624,2019-06-06,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: Obviously it's an unfortunate situation all the way around.  Credit Kyle the way he handled it.  A lot of different reactions you could have had, but he handled it correctly.  I know our team and our organization is addressing the situation and will act accordingly.  You don't want to see that in our game and hopefully it doesn't happen.","Player"
625,2019-06-06,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: Obviously he made shots and he's been in this stage before back in San Antonio and knows the sense of urgency of the moment and those big spots.  Last night he hit a lot of just momentum threes, whether it was end of quarters or us making a run and getting it to seven, six, and him making a shot.","Player"
626,2019-06-06,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: Not personally, no","Player"
627,2019-06-06,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: I just answered it","Player"
628,2019-06-06,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: I didn't see it in realtime, so I didn't know exactly what happened.  I saw Kyle's reaction.  But obviously when you see the video, it's pretty clear who was in the wrong.  And again, we'll -- I know the team is handling it the way that they should in terms of not letting him back in the stadium for The Finals, and then whatever happens after that.","Player"
629,2019-06-06,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: Being down 2-1 gives us all the motivation we need, honestly.  There is a bigger story around this building, and it being the last year and what's at stake with that, but it all kind of boils down to us trying to win a championship no matter where we're playing at.","Player"
630,2019-06-06,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: I'm not sure, just knowing he's trying to get back as soon as possible and there's certain checkpoints he has to go through.  The way that we have handled it to date is what's the focus today, who is able to play, who is not, and how are we going to go out there and give our best effort.","Player"
631,2019-06-06,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: Everything.  He's an All-World athlete who makes your team better.  So it's a tough blow, but we still have a great opportunity in front of us, and we're going to lay it all out there on the line to try to get it done","Player"
632,2019-06-06,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: There's nothing janky about yesterday, let's put it that way.  It was -- I mean, they showed bodies, they threw different guys at me.  I was just a little bit more aggressive, trying to look for shots, but I assume there's going to be subtle adjustments, trying to get the ball out of my hands earlier in the possession.  But there are things that I can do to counteract that and still make an impact on that end of the floor.","Player"
633,2019-06-06,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: I mean, I got up 31 shots, so it was a lot just being aggressive.  Again, no matter what defense is thrown at you, there are things that I can do to still again make plays.  And at the end of the day I -- some shots you know you can make and live with the results, so no matter what adjustments they make, I still feel confident","Player"
634,2019-06-06,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: That's definitely MO of his, but I think honestly any great player who is a great leader and doesn't mind putting himself out there, they're going to, we're all going to say what we could have done better.  Even myself last night I'm nitpicking things that -- or possessions that I wanted back or looking for adjustments that I can personally make going into Game 4 knowing I played well but I can play better.","Player"
635,2019-06-06,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: I mean, honestly, I know if he didn't say nothing, I know, just having been around him for the last seven, eight years, that he probably lost some sleep based on our whole team's performance, so -- and just the fact that we lost, like it's not a good feeling for anybody, especially a competitor like that.  So whether he vocalizes it or not, I know what his mindset is and would bet on it for Game 4","Player"
636,2019-06-06,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: I mean, that's a tricky situation because it is the Finals and I know Klay was dying and begging to play.  And I've been in that situation as well where you feel like you can give the team something, even if it's not a hundred percent, and you're not really thinking about the ramifications of an even more serious injury in that moment because we just want to play.","Player"
637,2019-06-06,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DEMARCUS COUSINS: What am I cautious about?  They're a talented team.  Plenty of talent on the floor.  They got a threat from every position.  So that's more than enough to be worried about","Player"
638,2019-06-06,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DEMARCUS COUSINS: Play better","Player"
639,2019-06-06,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DEMARCUS COUSINS: I don't know","Player"
640,2019-06-06,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DEMARCUS COUSINS: It's part of the game.  Some nights they don't fall.  So hopefully next game it's a better showing, get some shots to fall","Player"
641,2019-06-06,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DEMARCUS COUSINS: Come out ready to play tomorrow.  We went over our mistakes.  We're a confident group and feel like we got a great chance with Game 4.  So we'll see what happens","Player"
642,2019-06-06,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DEMARCUS COUSINS: That's unacceptable.  Just nothing around it -- it's just unacceptable.","Player"
643,2019-06-05,"Nick Nurse","Postgame","Toronto Win","NICK NURSE: Well, I think Danny's buckets I think boosted our whole team's confidence because we're kind of used to most of the year relying on those.  I think that when he banked a couple there and then he kind of kept it going, I think it was just a huge confidence boost all around","Coach"
644,2019-06-05,"Nick Nurse","Postgame","Toronto Win","NICK NURSE: Yeah, I had a little talk with him before the game, and his kind of comments to me was he was going to let it rip tonight.  So that was good.  You saw him aggressive in transition, but, again, usually when he's going good, it means he's hitting the paint, he's attacking off the screen and roll and really getting downhill.  That's usually a sign that he's got a lot of his offensive game and confidence going","Coach"
645,2019-06-05,"Nick Nurse","Postgame","Toronto Win","NICK NURSE: Well, our offense wasn't very good in Game 2 and we knew that was hurting our defense as well.  We tried to play with more pace up the court, and we tried to play with more pace in the half court.  I thought you just saw a lot more cutting and passing, obviously 30 assists, you saw a lot more shots go in, that helps, right?","Coach"
646,2019-06-05,"Nick Nurse","Postgame","Toronto Win","NICK NURSE: Well, I think Serge Ibaka had a great second half especially.  He was active and was covering up a bunch of our mistakes, or not necessarily mistakes, when we would go put two guys on Curry, they have been great at hurting us at the rim.","Coach"
647,2019-06-05,"Nick Nurse","Postgame","Toronto Win","NICK NURSE: Listen, we were trying to play as straight up as we could.  We wanted to get back to doing what we normally do.  We didn't do anything really early in the game other than just try to play him.  He had a ton in the first half.  We tried to up our presence on him a little bit with some double teams, but it doesn't really matter, right, I mean, I don't really -- all that matters is -- my dad used to tell me the stats don't matter, just the final score.  So we'll just take the win and be thankful for that","Coach"
648,2019-06-05,"Nick Nurse","Postgame","Toronto Win","NICK NURSE: Well, it's not like it's a 30-minute sit-down, it's pretty quick, right, and actually one of the players had written that on the board, ""Let it rip,"" on our -- we got all our stuff up there, and there was this little handwritten ""Let it rip,"" and I said, Did you write that?  But he said, No, but that's what I'm thinking.  And that's the extent of the talk.  Sorry, that was it","Coach"
649,2019-06-05,"Nick Nurse","Postgame","Toronto Win","NICK NURSE: Yeah, I mean, you can't really worry about any of that stuff, right, like every one of these games is critical.  And I keep saying we have had a lot of this throughout the playoffs with other teams, guys out, we have had some guys out, et cetera, and you just -- five guys are going to be out there, right, and you can't really worry about that.","Coach"
650,2019-06-05,"Nick Nurse","Postgame","Toronto Win","NICK NURSE: Well, I think our team plays hard, right, and I think we expect them to make runs and baskets.  And in this game and this day and age, leads go quickly and all those kind of things.","Coach"
651,2019-06-05,"Nick Nurse","Postgame","Toronto Win","NICK NURSE: All right.  Thank you.","Coach"
652,2019-06-05,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: Yeah, I think the numbers dictate that scoring early in the shot clock is the best thing to do and scoring late is one of the worse things to do, right, over the course of NBA season or an NBA game.","Coach"
653,2019-06-05,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: Play better defense, yeah.  Play better defense.  Make them miss more.  Get it off the rim a little more than taking it out of the net.  That will help your transition game.  That will help your early offense","Coach"
654,2019-06-05,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: Yeah, we have a general kind of rule of thumb that once a shot goes up, we tell our guys to make a really quick, good decision.  Either they're going hard to the offensive rebound or they're going hard to defense transition.  And there's some guys that go a little more often.  Your stronger, longer athletic guys have a chance to keep some balls alive when they see an opening.  There's certain moments of the game -- I mean, some of those late are almost scrambles, right, you're behind five and you're throwing it up there and everybody's trying to rebound, just to keep the game alive as well.  But, yeah, we just -- that's kind of just our general rule of thumb.  Does that answer your question","Coach"
655,2019-06-05,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: Yeah, I think he's made a lot of those late in the game, and I think it's just -- again, it's just a tremendous competitive spirit to do anything and everything to try and either seal the game or get the game back, get the possession back.  And it's just -- I think it's been great.  It's tremendous will that he's showing to somehow come up with those","Coach"
656,2019-06-05,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: Well, he's a really good defensive player.  I mean, first of all, he's just a good player, but he's a problem defensively because he can switch and guard just about anybody out there.  And that's a big-time luxury.  That takes you out of -- that keeps people in front.  That takes you out of having to play weak side on the roller, right, and tagging and rotating and X'ing out and all those things that we -- terminology we have to cover screen and roll defense.  He's a good rebounder, and he's capable on offense to face up and knock one down or keep balls alive and get an offensive rebound.","Coach"
657,2019-06-05,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: Yeah, I think it's really special.  He's a good luck charm.  I don't know if you know, he played for me.  He played for me in -- I think it was '99, 2000.  Manchester Giants in Manchester, England.  He was a good player.  Won a championship with Phil there.  So he's really good at his craft.  Obviously he's one of the best, if not the best, player development coaches in the league.  And obviously he's from here, grew up here.  I think he would like to get a W against these guys, right here in his kind of neighborhood","Coach"
658,2019-06-05,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: I hope he wouldn't.  I'm probably not quite as durable as Kyrie and it might put me out for the summer","Coach"
659,2019-06-05,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: No -- you don't have to apologize -- I don't -- I don't -- my playlist is pretty short.  I'm just -- I'm not very good.  If I was a golfer, I would be about shooting about 120 on 18 holes, if that's my -- if I was comparing my guitar playing to golf.  Like a little Johnny Cash, Bob Dylan, that kind of stuff","Coach"
660,2019-06-05,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: Yeah, how?  I think Kyle discovered it, actually, last year sometime.  I don't remember exactly when, but I think Kyle figured that out if he called it in the middle, you could take it either side.","Coach"
661,2019-06-05,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: It doesn't impact it very much.  I think we're at the point of this series where we got to get out and guard these dudes, right, whoever's out there.  We got to get playing our defense, right, quit worrying so much about special plays, this, that, and the other thing.  We need to get into the ball.  When you're guarding it, be great at guarding the ball; when your man doesn't have it, help, make the rotations; if somebody goes to help, help the helper.  Fly out at shooters and block out.  We got to do a better job of that if we want to win","Coach"
662,2019-06-05,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: Yup.  Well, first of all, he's -- I think he's got two Olympic silver medals under his belt as a head coach.  He's been a head coach for about 30 years now.  And he has a really special relationship with one of our players and now two, right.  When we hired him, he'd had Serge Ibaka on the Spanish national team, and I think it's been a big help.","Coach"
663,2019-06-05,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: Okay.  Enjoy the game.","Coach"
664,2019-06-05,"Kyle Lowry","Postgame","Toronto Win","KYLE LOWRY: I think it was more of a message for the team.  We shot 38 threes tonight and we got up a lot of threes, a lot of attempts and just played basketball.","Player"
665,2019-06-05,"Kyle Lowry","Postgame","Toronto Win","KYLE LOWRY: Yeah, I mean, when you lose an All-NBA type basketball player in Klay and an All-Star, it definitely changes their team, but Steph had an unbelievable game.  47 points is pretty impressive.  But we just got to go out there and do our job, and I think we held them under 40 percent shooting.  We played well, we finished the game, and we found a way to win the basketball game","Player"
666,2019-06-05,"Kyle Lowry","Postgame","Toronto Win","KYLE LOWRY: Kept the pace up, kept our pace up and kept going and trying to get the ball out quick and getting stops and communication and just kept playing.  We know that they always can make runs in this building, but we stayed level headed, just continued to kind of just keep going and going and going and staying in the moment","Player"
667,2019-06-05,"Kyle Lowry","Postgame","Toronto Win","KYLE LOWRY: For us we just we know that they're going to make good runs and make shots.  But we watched that third quarter Game 2, and we just got to continue to play with pace.  And that was the one thing about it, we played with pace half court, full court, and that was a big thing for us.","Player"
668,2019-06-05,"Kyle Lowry","Postgame","Toronto Win","KYLE LOWRY: Just got to prepare the same way.  We're a real defensive-minded team.  We know they got those type of weapons.  But we got to just prepare ourselves to be focused on ourselves.","Player"
669,2019-06-05,"Kyle Lowry","Postgame","Toronto Win","KYLE LOWRY: He got a lot of championships in England and in G League.  I mean, Nick, he looks young, but he's pretty old.  But he's been doing this a long time, man, and his demeanor, like I said this before, he literally has yelled at us like twice this whole season and his demeanor is just kind of just keep going and keep going and figure it out and, all right, this is what we're going to do, this is what's happening.","Player"
670,2019-06-05,"Kyle Lowry","Postgame","Toronto Win","KYLE LOWRY: I think we just added a couple great pieces, adding Kawhi and Marc and Danny, with their professionalism, I think their championship -- Danny's and Kawhi's championship pedigree, Nick's coming in as a coach that's won a few championships in G League, and we got Patrick McCaw who got a couple championships.  We got a bunch of guys who are professionals, and we got a good veteran group.  And we all kind of just understand that this is our job and never get too up, never get too down.  Teams are going to make runs, and you're going to not win every game, you're not going to lose every game, but you can continue to grow to the point to play until June, and that was always the goal with this team was to get to June.","Player"
671,2019-06-05,"Kyle Lowry","Postgame","Toronto Win","KYLE LOWRY: Thank you.","Player"
672,2019-06-05,"Kawhi Leonard","Postgame","Toronto Win","KAWHI LEONARD: It feels good.  I don't think about what happened two years ago, pretty much living in the now and just happy we were able to get a Game 3 win, another step closer to our goal","Player"
673,2019-06-05,"Kawhi Leonard","Postgame","Toronto Win","DANNY GREEN: I think we all kind of followed that advice, but it's just easier to look at that now and say it worked great for us, especially on a great shooting night.","Player"
674,2019-06-05,"Kawhi Leonard","Postgame","Toronto Win","DANNY GREEN: He's a pure shooter.  I don't know if you guys knew that or not (laughter)","Player"
675,2019-06-05,"Kawhi Leonard","Postgame","Toronto Win","DANNY GREEN: Yeah, I spoke to him before the game briefly.  He's always on the TNT set.  He was out there right before the game.  And every time I see him, he's giving me his pure shooting advice, because he was good at it.","Player"
676,2019-06-05,"Kawhi Leonard","Postgame","Toronto Win","DANNY GREEN: I'll take this one since he answers probably a ton of them.  But our fans have been amazing for us throughout the whole season.  And in the playoffs especially.  The first two games they did a great job.  We didn't hold our end up in Game 2.  But we had to come back home hopefully keeping them proud, or make them proud.  And hopefully upping the series would be great.","Player"
677,2019-06-05,"Kawhi Leonard","Postgame","Toronto Win","KAWHI LEONARD: It was very important, but I really didn't find out until the tip-off started.  They told us that he was playing tonight, and that was the mindset going out on the floor that's playing.  And it was a lot of pressure, it's a lot of pressure, too, if one of the main guys is not playing, they can still come out and get a win.  Steph played great tonight.  But it was big.  I'm happy we got it.  Two wins away now and let's see what this momentum carries us to","Player"
678,2019-06-05,"Kawhi Leonard","Postgame","Toronto Win","KAWHI LEONARD: I used to say that back when I was in high school and college.  Just wanting to get to this league, just -- it's about working hard, basically, outworking the opponent.  Rebounds help you win games, big rebounds, offensive rebounds, limiting the team to one shot.  And that used to be our motto, just some of us that were in college that was trying to get to this point.  I forgot your first two questions","Player"
679,2019-06-05,"Kawhi Leonard","Postgame","Toronto Win","KAWHI LEONARD: Once I'm driving in the paint, kicking out to guys that are making shots, the defense doesn't want to collapse as easy, and we just got to keep playing them in a flow, really.  I feel like we just don't need to worry about me scoring the basketball, we all can score with the offense that we have, just got to keep moving.  At times when I do have the ball, the offense gets real stagnant and we just stay in one spot, and that's so easy to guard if you're defending us.  So it's about just moving the ball, playing the team sport and trusting everyone","Player"
680,2019-06-05,"Kawhi Leonard","Postgame","Toronto Win","DANNY GREEN: Oh, I wouldn't say hot, but I was comfortable.  We had a good rhythm.  We had a good flow, we had a good couple stops to where we can run and get our transition or where we get some good uncontested looks.  We had a few good looks, and they fell for me.","Player"
681,2019-06-05,"Kawhi Leonard","Postgame","Toronto Win","DANNY GREEN: Huge.  All year that's why I love playing with the guy so much, because he's a big reason why I get so many look, him and Pascal.  Them being -- him being the quarterback and Pascal being the wide receiver and he throwing that ball ahead and the defense collapse, it's kick out open looks for me.  And when he's -- Kawhi obviously penetrating, attacking the basket transition, they collapse, there's some good looks for us.  And in the half court set, it's a little easier to guard that and matchup.","Player"
682,2019-06-05,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Toronto Win","STEVE KERR: Oh, very proud.  They played really, really hard and gave it everything they had and just ran into a better team tonight.  Toronto played an excellent game, made big shots every time they needed to.  We never could get over the hump.  Every time we fought back and kind of got it to six, seven or eight, whatever it was, they made big shots.","Coach"
683,2019-06-05,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Toronto Win","STEVE KERR: Steph was incredible.  The stuff he does is, he does things that honestly I don't think anybody has ever done before.  The way he plays the game, the way he shoots it and the combination of his ball handling and shooting skills, it's incredible to watch.  He was amazing","Coach"
684,2019-06-05,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Toronto Win","STEVE KERR: Well, the whole point was to not risk a bigger injury that would keep him out of the rest of the series.  So that was the decision we made, and I feel very comfortable with it.","Coach"
685,2019-06-05,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Toronto Win","STEVE KERR: That's, you know, internal business, so..","Coach"
686,2019-06-05,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Toronto Win","STEVE KERR: Yeah, it's one of the reasons we didn't have Andre on the floor at the end of the game for those last five minutes.  He was up over 30 minutes, and this is the only -- these are the only two games in this series where there's just one day off.  So we tried to watch Shaun Livingston's minutes and DeMarcus had something going on late in the game, he left the bench to get checked out.  And so the guys we pushed were Draymond and Steph, but they're in the primes of their lives, so they're capable of handling that","Coach"
687,2019-06-05,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Toronto Win","STEVE KERR: I think he's fine.  I think he just -- he went to the locker room with about maybe three, four minutes left, just to get checked out.  I think he's fine","Coach"
688,2019-06-05,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Toronto Win","STEVE KERR: I just knew we were going to score 109 points because that's all we're going to do the rest of this series.  So if we're going to keep scoring 109, we got to keep them to 108 and that's the biggest thing.  They scored 123 points, shot 52 percent, so it was more about their play, their execution offensively, their shot making.  Our offense could have done better.  Obviously we didn't shoot it great, but give them credit.  They outplayed us","Coach"
689,2019-06-05,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Toronto Win","STEVE KERR: Yes.  Defense.  Defense wins in the playoffs, especially in The Finals.  So we got to play better defense","Coach"
690,2019-06-05,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Toronto Win","STEVE KERR: I think Kyle set a tone, played a great game for them and set a really good tone early.  Made some shots, controlled the game, and so he was -- he was a huge factor for them.  Played a fantastic game","Coach"
691,2019-06-05,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Toronto Win","STEVE KERR: Well, yeah, I mean, Klay's one of our best defenders so we missed his defense.  But, again, that doesn't matter.  The guy's hurt, doesn't play; then you play the next guy.","Coach"
692,2019-06-05,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: Well, our guys have been together for a long time.  We got a lot of talent.  And because the team has played together for many years, they just -- they have a good feel for what we're trying to do for each other's strengths and weaknesses, and I think they complement one another very well.","Coach"
693,2019-06-05,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: It's a game-time decision.  He's going to come in here and work with the training staff in a little bit, and we'll decide then","Coach"
694,2019-06-05,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: He had a really good workout yesterday, ramped it up, and it went well.  He had another one today, it went well.  So we would like to increase it tomorrow, meaning get other people involved, he hasn't played any three-on-three, five-on-five.","Coach"
695,2019-06-05,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: He's making a very strong case.  That's who Klay is.  He wants to play no matter what.  So we'll see what the trainers' assessment is.  They looked at him this morning, and they will look at him again this evening.","Coach"
696,2019-06-05,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: Well, he's got to continue to improve and not have any setbacks.  That's the main thing.  So we'll go from there","Coach"
697,2019-06-05,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: All of the above.  C.  That's what makes Klay special.  He's one of the best two-way players in the game, and that's true regular season and it's especially true in the playoffs against the very best players in the world.  So we'll have to make up for quite a bit if he's not out there","Coach"
698,2019-06-05,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: Well, I expect our crowd to be loud tonight and energetic.  I think they know that we need them more than ever, given our injury situation.  And this has always been an unbelievable home court advantage, so I expect a rowdy crowd tonight and whatever day the next game is.  Every day's Wednesday; that's what they say in the NBA.  It is Wednesday.  Who knew?  (Laughter.","Coach"
699,2019-06-05,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: That's the gist of it all, and our training staff will let us know the risk.  If there's risk, then we would not play him.  So he got some shots up this morning and got some running in on the court, so that's a good sign.  Training staff wanted to see how he responds when he comes in today after some rest at home.  And ultimately that's the -- to cut right to the core of it, it's still early in the series, so if there's risk, then we won't play him","Coach"
700,2019-06-05,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: He's definitely underappreciated.  He is an incredibly smart basketball player, just has a feel for the game at both ends.  Timing is always impeccable because he understands the game, sees the game a move ahead like most really good players do.","Coach"
701,2019-06-05,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: I'm too young to have remembered him as a player, so what I know about Bill is what I've read about him and what I've seen on grainy video.  One of the things I love about his game from the highlights and from reading about him is that he's one of the only bigs who would block a shot with the awareness to just keep it, keep possession.","Coach"
702,2019-06-05,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: Well, it's a little different feel starting the series on the road than at home.  But every series is unique unto itself, based on matchups, based on health, all that stuff.","Coach"
703,2019-06-05,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: Yeah, The Finals are always the biggest challenge you face, if you're lucky enough to get this far.  It's the most pressure, it's the biggest stage, it's usually the two best teams.  And so all of that stuff factors in.","Coach"
704,2019-06-05,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: A lot of my favorite memories come from being a player here and marveling at the energy in this building, coming from a crowd that did not have a whole lot to cheer for, frankly.  The Warriors went through a long dry spell, and yet you would come here and there was an atmosphere, an energy you could feel.","Coach"
705,2019-06-05,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: Thanks.","Coach"
706,2019-06-05,"Draymond Green","Postgame","Toronto Win","DRAYMOND GREEN: I don't view it as sacrificing.  We went out there and played hard and we lost.  We didn't go into this game thinking we're not going to play Klay or Kevin or Loon or anybody else, and we're just going to give this game away should they play well.  They knocked down I think 17 threes.  You got to give them credit.","Player"
707,2019-06-05,"Draymond Green","Postgame","Toronto Win","DRAYMOND GREEN: I think he made more shots than he's made.  Obviously he was way more aggressive than he's been, but he made shots","Player"
708,2019-06-05,"Draymond Green","Postgame","Toronto Win","DRAYMOND GREEN: We got to be more solid with the ball.  And it starts with me.  I've had a bunch of turnovers in I think every game this series.  So just take -- be more cautious with our passes.  I think they do have a lot of length, but we got to play in more space and not play in a crowd","Player"
709,2019-06-05,"Draymond Green","Postgame","Toronto Win","DRAYMOND GREEN: I mean, it's more difficult than with them.  I think that goes without saying, but nonetheless we got guys that can step up, and we just didn't play well enough tonight.  So it is what it is","Player"
710,2019-06-05,"Draymond Green","Postgame","Toronto Win","DRAYMOND GREEN: I think Bogut played great in his minutes, but obviously Loon has been great for us all year, so not having him out there definitely makes a difference.  Not having anyone makes a difference because everyone -- when you assemble a team, everyone brings something different.  But no one cares if guys are hurt.  Everybody wants to see us lose.  So I'm sure people are happy they're hurt.  We just got to continue to battle and win the next game, go back to Toronto, win Game 5, come back to Oracle, win Game 6 and then celebrate.  Fun times ahead","Player"
711,2019-06-05,"Draymond Green","Postgame","Toronto Win","DRAYMOND GREEN: It's a great team.  Any time you make it to the NBA Finals, you're playing against another great team.  So it's always going to be challenging.  We can sit and talk about the injuries until we're blue in the face, it's not going to change how Kevin's calf feels or how Looney -- what's it called?  Yeah, no it was like some costal cartilage fracture, something like that, it's not going to make that feel better.  And it ain't going to make Klay's hamstring feel better either.","Player"
712,2019-06-05,"Draymond Green","Postgame","Toronto Win","DRAYMOND GREEN: He was amazing.  I got to play better and offer him more help.  I think if I played better with the night that he had, we would have won.  So we need him to continue to be aggressive like he's been, and all of us got to continue to fill in and be better.","Player"
713,2019-06-05,"Draymond Green","Postgame","Toronto Win","DRAYMOND GREEN: I think they were throwing bodies at him.  I think y'all might have talked Nick Nurse off the box-and-one.  He folded under pressure a little bit I think -- I'm just playing.  But they definitely threw bodies at him, and we got to do a better job of when they're throwing two and three guys at him of converting.","Player"
714,2019-06-05,"Stephen Curry","Postgame","Toronto Win","STEPHEN CURRY: Any injury in the playoffs is tough, but especially a guy like Klay who's been so durable his whole career and especially in the playoffs and the way he had been playing as of late, so it's no secret that we're a little injury plagued now and guys trying to just find a way back to the court.","Player"
715,2019-06-05,"Stephen Curry","Postgame","Toronto Win","STEPHEN CURRY: I mean, I'm not sure.  That process takes care of itself when -- with the work that they're putting in and our training staff and all that","Player"
716,2019-06-05,"Stephen Curry","Postgame","Toronto Win","STEPHEN CURRY: Yeah, they played well the whole game, like you said.  Every time we made a run or got the crowd into it, they either made a tough three or there was a tough foul called and they slowed the tempo down or something went their way.","Player"
717,2019-06-05,"Stephen Curry","Postgame","Toronto Win","STEPHEN CURRY: I didn't see it, actually.  So I don't really know if there were any fireworks or anything like that, but you know Klay was -- like you said, he was giving it everything he had to be out there tonight.","Player"
718,2019-06-05,"Stephen Curry","Postgame","Toronto Win","STEPHEN CURRY: For sure.  Yeah","Player"
719,2019-06-05,"Stephen Curry","Postgame","Toronto Win","STEPHEN CURRY: Not really.  After two games you start to get a feel of what's available on that end of the floor, just trying to make the right reads.  And for the most part, we, not even myself, just we were aggressive getting to the paint and swinging the ball out.  We were a little rushed early.  But we were just trying to create good offense, and I think this is the third game in a row we scored 109.  It's just a matter of our defense and we can't fall into the trap of thinking offense alone is going to win us another championship or letting that end of the floor affect our defense.  That will be the biggest adjustment for us Game 4 all across the board","Player"
720,2019-06-05,"Stephen Curry","Postgame","Toronto Win","STEPHEN CURRY: There's nothing different he should do, just continue to play with confidence.  It was a rough go in terms of when he had the ball in his hands, there was some calls that were a little iffy, honestly, in terms of him being aggressive in the paint and not being able to finish for a lot of different reasons.","Player"
721,2019-06-05,"Stephen Curry","Postgame","Toronto Win","STEPHEN CURRY: Just competitiveness and trying to play until the buzzer.  It's the Finals, whatever you try to do to win the game.  Nothing special, to be honest, it's just trying to make the right play, give everything you got, sacrifice your body when you have the opportunity.  There are guys on our team that do that on a nightly basis, and tonight just happened to be in a losing effort.  So we got to keep that same mentality and just play a full 48 like we're accustomed to doing","Player"
722,2019-06-05,"Stephen Curry","Postgame","Toronto Win","STEPHEN CURRY: He's just consistent.  They usually try to have him press up full court try and make me work.  I just try to make the simple decision, continue to try to get downhill in the paint and, honestly, the way that they load their defense in transition sometimes or even in the half court, he knows he has help behind him so he can be a lot more aggressive on the ball, and they give him the freedom to do that.","Player"
723,2019-06-05,"Stephen Curry","Postgame","Toronto Win","STEPHEN CURRY: He's such a smart basketball player and he controls a lot of the pace for them.  Nights where he gets it going scoring-wise he can make it tough on you because they do have a lot of weapons around and they like to space the floor.  He has the ball in his hand a lot as a distributor, but when he can turn it on, putting the ball in the basket, it's just that much tougher.","Player"
724,2019-06-05,"Stephen Curry","Postgame","Toronto Win","STEPHEN CURRY: I mean, we fought, but we lost.  So we got to go back to the drawing board and just recalibrate for Game 4.  It's kind of been like a roller coaster type of series these first three games, and I like the -- I like the things that we saw tonight that we can make adjustments on and protect home court on Friday.","Player"
725,2019-06-04,"Fred VanVleet","Practice","N/A","FRED VANVLEET: It will probably change our defensive coverages and kind of the way we're approaching our schemes.  Obviously we know what KD brings to the table, and we'll have to adjust a little bit what we do.  But if he's not playing tomorrow, then we'll worry about that after we take care of Game 3.  So all of our focus is on Game 3, and we'll worry about whatever comes after that","Player"
726,2019-06-04,"Fred VanVleet","Practice","N/A","FRED VANVLEET: The regular season doesn't really matter.  We knew that we could play with this team, and we know that from obviously not only the regular season but just that we're a great team and neither one of us were playing playoff-level basketball at the time, so you don't really try to take too much from that.","Player"
727,2019-06-04,"Fred VanVleet","Practice","N/A","FRED VANVLEET: Not at all.  We kind of let you guys worry about that type of stuff.  As players we respect their entire roster. ","Player"
728,2019-06-04,"Fred VanVleet","Practice","N/A","FRED VANVLEET: Yeah, I mean, well, hopefully you go through the regular season free of injury for this moment.  We all play for this moment.  The NBA is set up that way.  Everything boils down to the Finals.","Player"
729,2019-06-04,"Fred VanVleet","Practice","N/A","FRED VANVLEET: I can imagine it, yeah.  Hopefully that happens.  I can imagine it.  I understand what those guys have been through.  It's unbelievable.  It's nothing to take lightly, and it's a great accomplishment, and just it speaks to their character and their DNA and what makes them who they are that they're able to keep that level of consistency and play at that level of greatness for that long.","Player"
730,2019-06-04,"Fred VanVleet","Practice","N/A","FRED VANVLEET: Probably a combination of all -- I think at this point it's just physical.  You've been playing for a very long time -- mentally you're so locked in and juiced up that you want to just -- I think that just it's a combination of those things.  I think mentally you're pretty locked in because it's the Finals, it's what you dream of.  This is what you want to do.  So you're not drained there.  Physically it's just bumps and bruises that you take along the season.  But what else would you rather be doing","Player"
731,2019-06-04,"Fred VanVleet","Practice","N/A","FRED VANVLEET: It's unbelievable, man.  It speaks to our great league that we have and the reach that the League has grown to to show the growth of being a global game.  And obviously we appreciate fans from all over the world, and it's just really cool to see how far the game can go and it's going to continue to keep growing.  And our game is a global game, and it's trending upwards.  So as players we appreciate all of our fans, and it's just been unbelievable.","Player"
732,2019-06-04,"Klay Thompson","Practice","N/A","KLAY THOMPSON: It will be a game-time decision.  But for me personally, it would be hard to see me not playing.  Hopefully I'll feel much better tomorrow and be a go for tip-off","Player"
733,2019-06-04,"Klay Thompson","Practice","N/A","KLAY THOMPSON: Obviously I would do anything I can to be out there, but it's all in their hands.  If there's any pain, it will be a no-go just because of the position we're in.  This could be a longer series, so there's no point in trying to go out there and re-aggravate it and potentially keep myself out of the whole entire Finals instead of just one game.","Player"
734,2019-06-04,"Klay Thompson","Practice","N/A","KLAY THOMPSON: Oh, it's much better than it was Sunday night.  So hopefully the same progress will be made and I'll be moving like my normal self tomorrow.  But the pain level wasn't too crazy at all","Player"
735,2019-06-04,"Klay Thompson","Practice","N/A","KLAY THOMPSON: I didn't mind it because we ended up winning the game.  Dre [Andre Iguodala] got a great look there at the end for the dagger.  I don't think it was the best strategy because we did get open looks, but we didn't score too well in those last six minutes with it.  That doesn't matter because, like I said, we made the buckets when they needed to be made the most","Player"
736,2019-06-04,"Klay Thompson","Practice","N/A","KLAY THOMPSON: I anticipated getting hit, which I probably shouldn't have done.  I landed awkwardly, just kind of tweaked my hamstring.  When you're moving, it's all good.  But right when you stop moving around, it just really tightened up on me like a knot and I couldn't really get any full motion anymore.","Player"
737,2019-06-04,"Klay Thompson","Practice","N/A","KLAY THOMPSON: Last year I think I was in a much worse position than I am now, which is good.  That's a good sign.  Injuries are never fun.  It's the most unfortunate part of sports, but it tests your character.  And playing through pain makes it all worth it in the end, especially this time of the year.","Player"
738,2019-06-04,"Klay Thompson","Practice","N/A","KLAY THOMPSON: Kawhi is so big and strong you can't really muscle him.  You can't really force him off his path.  All you can do is try to take away his air space.  He's become such a good ball handler, such a great shooter, especially in the mid-range, that you have to do anything you can to take his rhythm away.","Player"
739,2019-06-04,"Klay Thompson","Practice","N/A","KLAY THOMPSON: I think it's just when I have to stop on a dime or make hard cuts.  That's when you feel it the most.  But if I can just be out there even at 80 percent, I still think I can be very effective.  I'll do whatever I can to get to that full hundred. But if not, I'll still be out there and trying to do what I can to help my team win","Player"
740,2019-06-04,"Klay Thompson","Practice","N/A","KLAY THOMPSON: That's a good question.  Probably, if you only feel it on a certain couple moves, you're fine.  But if you feel it every step of the way, that's not a good sign.  I do not feel it with every move I make, only on certain ones.","Player"
741,2019-06-04,"Klay Thompson","Practice","N/A","KLAY THOMPSON: Well, something's got to give.  It's the NBA Finals, and we're putting our bodies on the line every game.  That's just the nature of our business, injuries.  And obviously we have such a great training staff that they're closing that risk of window for me by the hour.","Player"
742,2019-06-04,"Klay Thompson","Practice","N/A","KLAY THOMPSON: No problem.","Player"
743,2019-06-04,"Pascal Siakam","Practice","N/A","PASCAL SIAKAM: Every possession counts and I think definitely we are playing against champions and guys that's been there.  Obviously they know how to make adjustments because they have done it before.  We also have a team of veterans and guys that know what's going on.  It's definitely something like that where we need to make adjustments and people are going to bring, you're going to have different matchups and it feels like every possession changes, not changes but like make a judgment or try to do different things or other teams do different things.  So it's definitely interesting","Player"
744,2019-06-04,"Pascal Siakam","Practice","N/A","PASCAL SIAKAM: I think that it doesn't get easier, I wouldn't say that, but I think it's just interesting that you have to be able to adjust, like, that's the playoffs.  That's why you play the best out of seven.  So there's going to be a lot of games and people will see exactly what you do and they're going to look at that and you have to find ways to adjust.  And it's fun, it's fun and I think that's part of growing and being at this level is being able to adjust","Player"
745,2019-06-04,"Pascal Siakam","Practice","N/A","PASCAL SIAKAM: Right, well I mean obviously there's definitely highs and lows, but at the same time I think the most important thing for me is being able to impact the game without scoring or because at the end of the day if you score 30 points like you're the best ever.  But if you score 10 it doesn't matter what you did, it is your worse game.  So I think for me it's knowing that, especially with the team that we have, is that I can score sometimes and score 30 and sometimes I can score 10, but I have to be able to have an impact to the game and on defense and being able to bring that energy to the team.  That's something that has to be consistent and maybe I could have had a better energy or anything like that, but I think that just making sure that the things that got me there or the things that I do well and I can do without -- like I can control those things.  I have to be able to do those things consistently every single game","Player"
746,2019-06-04,"Pascal Siakam","Practice","N/A","PASCAL SIAKAM: I think we have been on the road throughout the playoffs and we kind of know what's expected.  But at the same time Oracle arena the fans are incredible here.  So it's definitely going to be a great atmosphere and playoff type environment on the road, so it's fun.  We have been in these games before, so we just got to go out there and be ourselves","Player"
747,2019-06-04,"Pascal Siakam","Practice","N/A","PASCAL SIAKAM: No, because we all know that they're a great team regardless.  At the end of the day we don't look at that.  I think for us it's more about us just making sure that we do all things that we're supposed to do in terms of game plan and making sure that we bring the intensity and energy that we have.  Because at the end of the day it doesn't matter who they have, we got to deal with the guys with the same intensity against anybody that we play.  So it's not like, oh, if Kevin Durant isn't playing or there person is not playing, we're going to need to have that same intensity in order to be able to beat those guys","Player"
748,2019-06-04,"Pascal Siakam","Practice","N/A","PASCAL SIAKAM: I think just got to be able to adjust.  I don't know what to tell you.  But I think it's the playoffs, you play good sometimes and you make shots and it's all good.  And then you don't one day.  And the next time you got to be able to shake it off and find a way, find other ways to attack or different things to do","Player"
749,2019-06-04,"Pascal Siakam","Practice","N/A","PASCAL SIAKAM: The style of play?  I mean obviously they are a transition team and they play fast, they play really, really fast.  We have to be able to, those first eight seconds of the shot clock we can't have them score and that's where they are the best, shooting threes, running, we have to be able to make them play in the half court a little bit more","Player"
750,2019-06-04,"Pascal Siakam","Practice","N/A","PASCAL SIAKAM: I don't see -- I don't think it affects","Player"
751,2019-06-04,"Pascal Siakam","Practice","N/A","PASCAL SIAKAM: No.  I don't think so.  In terms of the way we play","Player"
752,2019-06-04,"Pascal Siakam","Practice","N/A","PASCAL SIAKAM: Okay","Player"
753,2019-06-04,"Pascal Siakam","Practice","N/A","PASCAL SIAKAM: No, I don't think it affects me","Player"
754,2019-06-04,"Pascal Siakam","Practice","N/A","PASCAL SIAKAM: I think it's kind of hard, like it was early in the season and definitely a lot of things changed.  It's definitely hard to draw from those games because we don't really know, I don't think we have much data from those games, but just knowing, I mean the type of player he is, he definitely affects the game in a whole different level, just being able to score the basketball like he can.  He's also like another rim protector for them too.  So all those things combined definitely are a big part of what they do","Player"
755,2019-06-04,"Pascal Siakam","Practice","N/A","PASCAL SIAKAM: Yeah, I don't know.  I think that that's another great shooter, a guy that's a big part of what they do, so I don't know, we don't know if he's going to play or not, I don't know what that is, so we just go out there and kind of like prepare like he's going to play.","Player"
756,2019-06-04,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: We're trying to play as normally as we can.  It's always a game of rhythm a little bit and you have to watch what's happening.  As you know, we talk a lot about our shot spectrum, the shots we're trying to get.  We have to get a certain amount of paint touches.  We have to get the ball side to side.  Those are things you just have to keep an eye on.  I think we just had some lulls in those three areas in Game 2","Coach"
757,2019-06-04,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: The biggest thing I always say is getting the head coaching experience.  The interesting thing about the D-League is that one of the things about being a head coach is you have to get up in front of the team and run the team.","Coach"
758,2019-06-04,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: Well, first of all, I learn a lot of things when I come to these press conferences.  You guys tell me a lot of things.  So a lot of times I don't know about much of the noise until somebody asks me a question about it.","Coach"
759,2019-06-04,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: Yeah, he obviously came out with a certain game plan against Gasol.  The first possession of the game he went out and damn near tackled him, and then the ball went out of bounds and he clobbered him again on the way out of bounds.  So he was obviously going to go out there and try to physically intimidate him.","Coach"
760,2019-06-04,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: We were having trouble getting our defense set up.  We were having trouble at the basket a little bit.  We were having trouble with the rhythm of the game there.  And usually you use any zone.  So it's a type of zone.  That's what you're using zone for a lot.","Coach"
761,2019-06-04,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: That's what happens","Coach"
762,2019-06-04,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: No, I was never that kind of player, but go on.","Coach"
763,2019-06-04,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: Well, in all those things -- first of all, your players have to have some faith in it.  I got a sense of, from them, that they were good with it in the timeout.","Coach"
764,2019-06-04,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: Like I mentioned, they tried to get up and rough him up and play him with some pressure out there on the perimeter.  Marc had some really good looks too.  In the quarter from hell, the third quarter that we had there, he had like three or four of the really good looks there -- one from about eight feet, one from about 10 feet and then one was a wide-open three.","Coach"
765,2019-06-04,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: There might be an adjustment to make, yeah","Coach"
766,2019-06-04,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: He's good.  I kind of keep saying it, he's good.  Really knows his body.  I think he's got a lot of minutes in him, 40-plus a night.  I think he's going to get his cracks at the shots.","Coach"
767,2019-06-04,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: Okay, thank you.","Coach"
768,2019-06-04,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: (Chuckling.)  Sometimes when your coach draws something up, you just kind of go with it.  It is what it is.  It's one of those things where Coach says, This is what we're going to do.  And we just did it.","Player"
769,2019-06-04,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: Never practiced that ever.  I don't think I've ever run a box-and-one in my life, I'm going to be honest with you","Player"
770,2019-06-04,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: Literally he drew Fred -- he said this is Steph, you have Steph.  He put me, Kawhi, Pascal and Marc on the board in spots and said, Stand there.  So, I mean, it was just like, Play defense.","Player"
771,2019-06-04,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: Nothing Nick does surprises me now on the on the court as a coach.  It doesn't surprise me.  That one kind of caught me off guard, but, yeah, it was innovative","Player"
772,2019-06-04,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: Yeah, Nick is very player friendly.  He'll ask us this or that, and he'll say are you guys comfortable with doing this or what do you think about this or that?  And a lot of the times the situations that he puts us in are to be successful.  He's done a good job of this year letting Pascal play kind of point forward games and putting different type of offenses and schemes and defensive schemes.  He's been really good.  We're in The Finals for a reason, and he's helped us get here","Player"
773,2019-06-04,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: I think we come into a sense of urgency, period.  No matter the situation.  We want to be the first to four, and every game is an urgent game.  You're in the NBA Finals, so it doesn't matter.  They still have professional basketball players down there, and they're really talented basketball players.  So you still got to be ready to go out there and play your butt off and play hard","Player"
774,2019-06-04,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: Just didn't play aggressive.  We didn't play with enough pace.  We watched the film and saw things that we wish we had back.  Those first three minutes of the third quarter, we wish we would have had back.  We got a couple shots that we missed.  Just the overall urgency of coming out with the third quarter, knowing how good they are as a good third-quarter team, we have to be a little bit more aggressive and assertive","Player"
775,2019-06-04,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: I don't know if that was their best shot.  They made a run, and we continued to play.  Basketball is a game of runs.  And we're never going to stop doing what we do. We want to continue to try to play hard and win the basketball game","Player"
776,2019-06-04,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: No.  We still had a chance to win the game at the end of the game.  We just kept playing and kept working.","Player"
777,2019-06-04,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: Just staying ready.  There's going to be opportunity with guys going down.  That's just the way it shakes out.  And that's what happens in professional sports, period.  So just guys being ready, playing with a lot of confidence, knowing that we're going to get that opportunity and coming in and make plays","Player"
778,2019-06-04,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: Just knowing that it's okay to make mistakes.  We're faced with all this pressure, all these cameras, all the media, everybody is watching in the world -- but it's basketball.  It's a game we have been playing our whole lives.","Player"
779,2019-06-04,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: Well, it's always a concern.  Taking care of the basketball is a concern for us.  So the possession game is huge.  For us to be successful throughout this series, I think that's going to be a big key","Player"
780,2019-06-04,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: It's our guards, our shooters being heady, knowing that they're not really going to leave their body.  So setting screens, you get guys open.  It frees up myself, it frees up Andre, Draymond, other guys.  And then we can make plays.  We can see those back cuts.  So it's just kind of playing, taking what the defense gives us","Player"
781,2019-06-04,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: It's home.  It's our home floor.  It's a place that we're very familiar with.  It's a place we won championships at.  We get our crowd behind us, gain some momentum, and we're tough to stop","Player"
782,2019-06-04,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: Yeah, definitely when I first got here, for sure.  I think that just comes with the nature of the unpredictable.  And as the years gone on, everybody expects you to win.  So maybe it's not as loud as it was when I first got here, but I fully expect it to be loud come tomorrow","Player"
783,2019-06-04,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: Okay.  We're okay.  It's The Finals.  So at this point in the year, everybody's playing through some type of injury","Player"
784,2019-06-04,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: Yeah, it's bittersweet.  It's tough.  At the end, it's a lot of history here, tradition, very prideful players.  We play for our fans here, all the support they gave us throughout the years, even before I got here.  So it means a lot to be able to play in front of this city","Player"
785,2019-06-04,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: This version is fun.  It's fun.  It really just feels like he's enjoying the moment.  It's so clich√© to say, but at this stage in our careers, coming in 14, 15 years ago, kind of gone through the highs and low, so you appreciate where you're at.  He's been out of the league.  Now to be at this stage in the league with a team, organization he's familiar with, it's great to be around","Player"
786,2019-06-04,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: Definitely.  Anytime you bring a big outside and can be a threat out there on the perimeter, it's going to bring your shot blockers outside and create more space for back cuts, create more space just for the offense in general.","Player"
787,2019-06-04,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: At that time you're just listening to the coach and trying to win the game.  So, well, myself, I will just speak for myself, I just went out there and tried to execute.  At times coming back in transition on the floor we forgot that we were in it, but we just kind of talked it out and still got into our locations","Player"
788,2019-06-04,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: Probably not.  Klay definitely wasn't on the floor at that time.  There's no telling when KD's going to come back either.  So I don't think it will work","Player"
789,2019-06-04,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: I mean, it happened a long time ago.  It's probably you guys are just finding out.  But it's not a big worry of mine","Player"
790,2019-06-04,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: I guess a guy that thinks outside the box.  He coached at a lot of different levels, seen a lot of different games, coached a lot of NBA games.  I really can't remember right now just on the spot of what he has done, but that's just how he is.  He is experimental, and a lot of times what he draws up on the board works","Player"
791,2019-06-04,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: Right now, it's a possible five games left and about 12 days.  If you can't run, then you're not going to be able to play.  That's how you pretty much measure things at this time.  That's all I could really say.  If you can't run, you definitely cannot play.  Just see how it goes in the first quarter.  Did it get worse or not?  You might be able to start the game off running, but then you might not be able to finish as good as you started just from fatigue and whatever is bothering you at that time","Player"
792,2019-06-04,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: A hundred percent.  I'm on the floor.  There are no excuses.  Everybody knows everyone's banged up, bruised up at this moment.","Player"
793,2019-06-04,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: I think it just comes natural, just by all NBA players.  There are just so much distractions from you playing in high school to college and now becoming a pro.  So it's probably just pretty much second nature at this point.  And like I said, I know about this way before even the playoffs started, so it's nothing new to me","Player"
794,2019-06-04,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: It's fun.  Been knowing Klay for a long time, just living in California.  I just go out and play still.  I'm not just playing against him at the moment.  They switch a lot.  They're a great defensive team, and just try to take the challenge","Player"
795,2019-06-04,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: It's just like me and anybody walking outside or whoever, whatever person you're talking to, everyone is different.  They're going to see the world different, life different.  That's pretty much how it is.  From going from one place to another, it's totally different people.","Player"
796,2019-06-04,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: Kevin won't play tomorrow, but he's ramping up his exercise routine, his workouts.  And Klay is day to day, so he's questionable.  And Loon [Kevon Looney] is out for the series.","Coach"
797,2019-06-04,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: Yeah, Andre is going to play","Coach"
798,2019-06-04,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: Yeah, he practiced","Coach"
799,2019-06-04,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: I think the idea is to provide the players the best possible care.  I think over the last couple of decades it's incredible the difference in the size of training staffs, the expertise, the overall knowledge that we have now compared to 20 years ago.","Coach"
800,2019-06-04,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: I think it's closer to the breastbone here.  It is part of the collarbone, from what I understand, kind of in that joint.  It's not anything that's going to be a problem long term.  But it's going to keep him out for the rest of the series, which is obviously a big blow for us and for him.  He's had such a great season, such a great postseason run.  Fortunately it won't affect his future, but it's a big loss for us","Coach"
801,2019-06-04,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: Yeah, just the way it goes.  We have been playing a hundred-plus games for five years now -- not all of our players, but our team.  So we have a lot of guys who have played long, difficult seasons.  They take great care of themselves.  But there's a certain amount of luck involved with this, too, and we know that.  We have been on both sides of that.  Some of our opponents have suffered injuries.  We have suffered injuries.  It's just part of the deal.  You just keep pushing forward","Coach"
802,2019-06-04,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: Well, he's been our leader since I've been here.  He leads by example.  I should clarify that.  He's been one of our key leaders.  Andre and Draymond I would single out as well.  But they all lead in their own unique ways.","Coach"
803,2019-06-04,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: Yeah, and that's not the only time that that has happened.  The other night was a good example.  We had to finish the game without Klay, without Kevin.  We did that in Game 5 of the Houston series, too, when Kevin got hurt.","Coach"
804,2019-06-04,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: Kevin is going to get on the floor at the practice facility later today.  He did not get on the floor here.  He was here for our film session and for some treatment, but he'll be getting some work in this afternoon.  He's out for tomorrow, but improving.  And we'll just keep updating you when we have something","Coach"
805,2019-06-04,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: I don't really look at it that way.  I haven't even stopped to think about whether this reminds me of any particular year or anything.  It's just part of the job.","Coach"
806,2019-06-04,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: In ninth grade a team played one against me.  Very proud to announce that.  I had a box-and-one, just like Steph.  So janky defenses have been going on for a long time.","Coach"
807,2019-06-04,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: Yeah, it was very effective.  The key with the zone is, or any janky defense for that matter, it just changes the rhythm.  Watching the tape, we had open looks that we didn't knock down.  But the rhythm changed and the look changed.  And so it was very effective.  They did a good job with that.","Coach"
808,2019-06-04,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: He says he's feeling well and that he's feeling a lot better today than he did yesterday.  And he thinks he'll be ready to go.  But as I said the other night, Klay is always going to say he's ready to go.  What we'll have to determine is is that a risk?  If he plays, are we risking anything?","Coach"

810,2019-06-04,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: Normal preparation.  I think this is our fifth one in a row, so just trying to stay focused day to day in the game and try to make the key adjustments to try to give ourselves the chance to be in similar positions as last game, with the lead late in the game","Player"
811,2019-06-04,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: if you got guys who are nicked up, banged up, hopefully the extra time theoretically should help you continue to recover.  Between Game 3 and 4, it's only one day, so hopefully guys continue to get better and not get worse after each game.  But we got 15 guys for a reason.  Everyone is trying to stay prepared and have that confidence to help the team","Player"
812,2019-06-04,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: The body is always the same as far as you're going to have nicks and bruises at the end of the year with so many games.  Every season is a long season.  I'm sure players, not too many teams have been in it this many times, unless you go back to Bill Russell and those guys.  They said they were playing in Chuck Taylors and they didn't have physical therapy that we have and they were really bruised and banged up.  So they would say if they can get through it, we can get through it","Player"
813,2019-06-04,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: In the team there's been growth, especially with the young guys. Watching Kevon Looney grow, and he's only 24 years old.  I don't think people understand what he brings to our team, because he's matured so much and he's learned so much in a short span.  I can only imagine if I was in that situation, being young and being just thrown into a situation like this where you have so many different dynamics with success and dealing with pressure and dealing with media and learning so much about the business of basketball.  That learning curve has been great for him, and he's taken it all in and used it on and off the court to make him a better basketball player, a better businessman and a better person.  So really excited for guys like that","Player"
814,2019-06-04,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: I'm not sure.  There are so many things going on right now that you just try to stay focused on the game.  But obviously that's something we talk about through the season.  We have had a great support system with our fans, one of the best fan bases in the whole Bay Area.  Being on the Oakland side, they really have been with this team throughout good and bad.  So it would be sweet to end it well for them","Player"
815,2019-06-04,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: I wouldn't probably say anything, which I think was probably good for me to have not known what I know now.  I don't know if I would be playing basketball if I knew now what I knew then.  Kind of just now, I'm too smart for my own good.","Player"
816,2019-06-04,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: I wasn't.  I didn't have many expectations.  No one knew too much about me.  I wasn't like a phenom coming out of high school or college.  So I was just happy to be here and I wanted to make it last as long as possible.","Player"
817,2019-06-04,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: I don't think it changes much.  We still have to play our game regardless.  Obviously you want to make those guys defend, which would help, I guess, on their offensive end; slow them down a little bit.  But either way, we just have to attack the way we have been attacking and hopefully keep our pace","Player"
818,2019-06-04,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: It's no different than what it has been all year.  If you want to be a championship team, you have to win on the road.  Obviously, the series is tied 1-1 right now, and in order to get home court back we have to win one here.  It would be nice to start with Game 3","Player"
819,2019-06-04,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: I guess it depends on how bad the injury is.  A lot of bumps and bruises you're going to play through, unless it's something serious.  It sucks that they have so many guys out and injured.  Obviously, we want to play against a hundred percent healthy team.  But it's the name of the game.","Player"
820,2019-06-04,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: I can imagine going to five Finals back-to-back.  I've been in two.  And it's a short summer.  It's a quick turnaround.  So just as much as it is draining physically, mentally and emotionally it's even tougher.  Usually the team that comes out on top is the team that's more locked in and that's not as emotionally or mentally drained.  The team that is the freshest is usually going to come out on top.  But it's tough.  It's been a long season.  We just have finish it off strong.  We got about two weeks left, hopefully a week and a half.  The team that actually can focus and lock in for that last stretch is usually the team that's going to come out on top","Player"
821,2019-06-04,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: We expect them to be loud as well.  Obviously, they want to win another championship.  It's a great atmosphere here.  But we have to do a good job of trying to keen the crowd out of it, not let them get on runs.  Continue to play good defense.  Not turn it over and not have any lulls in any parts of the game, especially the third quarter","Player"
822,2019-06-04,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: Not when it comes to that type of strategy, no.  You mean the box-and-one?  We haven't spoken about it.  We hadn't spoken about it","Player"
823,2019-06-04,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: Yeah, but previous to the last game, we hadn't spoken about it.  Obviously before we did it we had to talk about it, but previous to that game it wasn't something that was like, oh, should we try this, should we throw that in","Player"
824,2019-06-04,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: Some.  Some have worked and some haven't.  He's obviously a new coach, first year, but he has a lot of good strategies that work.  He also wants to hear what we feel comfortable implementing on that end of the floor, who is comfortable guarding what and strengths and weaknesses, especially on the defensive end of the floor.  So we all try to communicate and get on the same page.","Player"
825,2019-06-04,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: I think we have done a decent job.  We could obviously do better.  I think the biggest key is to continue to chase him and try to keep him off the free throw line.  He's got a ton of free throws that we shouldn't allow him to get.  Play him without fouling him.  But on our end of the floor offensively, we could probably do a better job. So we'll look at that and see what ways we can implement.","Player"
826,2019-06-04,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: I think we seen in Game 2 his minutes and production was going to be important for us to win this series, if that's what we're going to do.  So with Loon going down, other guys have to step up.  And so obviously Cous will continue to play more and more, but not that he's not capable","Player"
827,2019-06-04,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: Yeah, we have been faced with a bunch of different injuries now, Loon being the latest, and guys have continued to step up.  That's the reason that we are in this position we're in right now where we're coming home with the series tied 1-1, with a chance to go up 3-1 with these two games here at home.","Player"
828,2019-06-04,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: I think this building has been very special.  Not often do you get the opportunity to kind of close out an era in a building within a run that we're currently in right now.","Player"
829,2019-06-04,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: Oh, I think as much as it is physically, because it's a lot, and even as much as it is, as much of a grind as it is mentally, which is a lot, it's probably even more of a grind emotionally, with the emotions that you put into trying to win a championship and into the playoffs where you kind of just, the only thing you really do is focus on how do I get better for the game, how do I have my body ready to go to be in the best possible shape and condition entering the game that you possibly can.","Player"
830,2019-06-04,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: Done.  Like completely drained and wiped out.  But then you get to enjoy a couple months off and get right back at it","Player"
831,2019-06-04,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: Do I think he's a Hall of Famer or not?  Absolutely.  If the things that people say matters, matters, then how couldn't he be a Hall of Famer?  But we got another championship to win and then everybody will probably just stop with the debate and just go ahead and say it.  So I think we should just do that to help y'all out with y'all's debates.  It would be good","Player"
832,2019-06-04,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: As a teammate, you're playing the game.  You're not really out there like, Oh, man, DeMarcus is playing good, it's great.  You just kind of get lost in the game.  Obviously after the game ends you're happy for him and that he's able to experience that moment, but also understanding that those moments get greater and greater as the series goes on, as -- if you can win the series and obviously hang another banner, those moments get greater and greater.","Player"
833,2019-06-04,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: You know, I guess you want to find that balance of cherishing the run that we're on, but the reality is those guys who look back on their career heard the same thing.  Like you got to cherish it.  It's impossible.  Like you can't celebrate everything that goes on and expect to get the same production that you're giving without celebrating and staying locked in and focused on the task at hand.","Player"
834,2019-06-04,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: Of course","Player"
835,2019-06-04,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: Cousins has always been a great passer.  Their spacing, having those two guys getting so much attention.  The lanes get so much bigger.  But we have to do a good job of pressuring and making them catch in different places.  Have to move through and put more pressure on them and do a better job of staying connected to our guys","Player"
836,2019-06-04,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: Obviously there is.  Two great shooters coming at both sides, you have to be really good on them and the guy helping.  If you help a little too much too early or not communicate well enough, the basket is going to be wide open and it's hard to guard down there.","Player"
837,2019-06-04,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: I don't know what he meant by that.  I normally don't comment on other people's comments because you don't get the whole sense.  You just get a little bit of information.  So it's hard for me to comment on it.","Player"
838,2019-06-04,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: They run free and get to the actions they want.  They obviously are very dangerous -- their passing is in rhythm, their screening is in rhythm, their slips, everything.  It's like a domino effect for them, and one action triggers another.  It's pretty quick reads for them and their spacing is really good and they space out for a reason and with a meaning to every possession on the floor.","Player"
839,2019-06-04,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: He's a strong player.  If you want to win at a high level, no matter how strong you are, you have to play like you're really strong and that you have to win every physical battle.  When you're on the ball, off the ball, the successful players, they might not be the strongest ones, but they act and believe that they're the strongest ones.","Player"
840,2019-06-04,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: I didn't analyze [before].  I don't analyze him now either.  I try to help him as much as possible and help the team as much as possible on both ends and seeing the coverages that they're throwing at us.  Obviously, we haven't been together that long, but it is what it is.","Player"
841,2019-06-04,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: I don't know, that's a little Southern, North Carolina slang that I probably just pulled out of my back pocket.  It sounds right.  I don't really know what the true definition is.","Player"
842,2019-06-04,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: I honestly can't remember.  Probably last time I saw it was when I had a [Davidson] Wildcat jersey on, though","Player"
843,2019-06-04,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: Nothing changes.  Stay consistent with my approach every year, whether it's in training camp or in The Finals, everything in between.  Just trying to boost confidence, create the right perspective going into each game.","Player"
844,2019-06-04,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: It's just a continuation of kind of what I talked about after Game 2. It's just everybody being ready.  The way that we play, everybody feels involved on both ends of the floor and has an opportunity to impact the game, not necessarily scoring every possession but just playing within the flow and sharing the ball, moving, playing unselfishly.  Just a style where everybody is going to get touches and you just have to be confident and aggressive.","Player"
845,2019-06-04,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: Honestly, I don't need anybody's validation or praise or them to hype me up as other people in the league know who I am.  I always stay confident in my abilities and appreciative of the stage that I get to play on alongside my teammates, especially these last five years.","Player"
846,2019-06-04,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: I'm just happy for him, to be honest.  Like you said, there was so much uncertainty around his timeline coming back.  For this to be his first Finals experience, you can't be more happy for him to have an opportunity to really impact the series in a positive way for us.","Player"
847,2019-06-04,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: That's one of his main talents, being able to play-make, whether it's on the block or out on the perimeter or wherever he catches the ball.  I think for him it's just becoming still more confident in his ability to put pressure on defenses on the block and use his size, get some easy buckets down there.","Player"
848,2019-06-04,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DEMARCUS COUSINS: I'm good","Player"

851,2019-06-04,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DEMARCUS COUSINS: I would be lying if I say I didn't have my dog days, but I went through them, I pouted, I sulked, I felt sorry for myself and I just started the process.  Me just sitting around feeling sorry isn't going to help me get on the floor.","Player"
852,2019-06-04,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DEMARCUS COUSINS: Definitely the best scenario in a difficult situation, but obviously I wish it could have been avoided.  But these are the cards I was dealt, and I'm going to maneuver through the [expletive]","Player"
853,2019-06-04,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DEMARCUS COUSINS: Oh, I'm far from a finished product.  That's the encouraging part about all of this.  I know I got a lot of work to do.  I know I got a lot of room for improvement.  So obviously it's a process, and I just got to go through it","Player"
854,2019-06-04,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DEMARCUS COUSINS: Janky for sure","Player"
855,2019-06-04,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DEMARCUS COUSINS: Yeah, middle school, AAU, some high school days.  It's been awhile since I seen it in this setting.  But for sure, janky","Player"
856,2019-06-04,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DEMARCUS COUSINS: Family, that's who I lean on the most.  That's my circle.  So that's what gets me through everything","Player"
857,2019-06-04,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DEMARCUS COUSINS: No, I haven't enjoyed it yet.  I'm not really trying to.  I'm taking everything a day at a time, and good or bad I try to put those days behind me and just move forward.  Once everything is over and I can kind of sit back and chill, I'll reminisce on it","Player"
858,2019-06-04,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DEMARCUS COUSINS: I'm not getting too high or too low, I'm just -- I'm maneuvering through the [expletive].  And once everything comes to a close, then I'll sit back and kind of reflect.  But as of right now, I'm taking it a day at a time","Player"
859,2019-06-04,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DEMARCUS COUSINS: Oh, for sure.  He's an incredible player.  He's done it at the highest level before.  His experience and just the way he goes about the game, I mean you got to appreciate guys like that.","Player"
860,2019-06-02,"Fred VanVleet","Postgame","Golden State Win","FRED VANVLEET: Yeah, I think that obviously from our viewpoint I was picking up Steph, trying to make it tough on him, just trying to make one of those other guys make a play.  We got it down, I think me and Pascal maybe got Steph in the corner up there at the top of the half court, and I thought Kawhi had a good play on the ball.  He didn't come up with the loose ball and worked back around a little bit and found Iggy on the way back out and he got a wide-open look.  So at that point you're probably fighting for a rebounding position.  You never want to think that it's going in, as the other team.  So fighting for rebound position and obviously he knocked it down.  So that was a really big shot for him.","Player"
861,2019-06-02,"Fred VanVleet","Postgame","Golden State Win","FRED VANVLEET: No, I mean, we don't disrespect those guys.  We know that Iggy's made big shots in his whole career.  He's done that for that team for the last however many years, so we have seen that movie before.  We've seen him make that same shot before, but I think from our viewpoint, just the scheme and the way that we were trying to attack that possession, we wanted somebody else to shoot it.  And I think that we just got to do a better job of probably running back out at him when he does get that open look.  I haven't seen the play, so I don't know what the next rotation was, but we'll look at it and see how maybe next time we can try to be better","Player"
862,2019-06-02,"Fred VanVleet","Postgame","Golden State Win","FRED VANVLEET: Yeah, I think, I mean, overall I think just started too slow.  You can't do that against this team.  Missing every shot doesn't help, whatever, 10 possessions in a row we didn't score.  I'm not even sure.  It didn't feel like we were even getting in the paint to control the tempo or the flow of the game.","Player"
863,2019-06-02,"Fred VanVleet","Postgame","Golden State Win","FRED VANVLEET: No panic, just trying to get our offense going.  Like I said, I wasn't on the floor to start the third, so I can't speak to what those guys were thinking at the time, but once I got out there just trying to be aggressive and stay aggressive and get some points on the board just to try to weather that storm and weather the run that they were putting on us.","Player"
864,2019-06-02,"Fred VanVleet","Postgame","Golden State Win","FRED VANVLEET: Yeah, it's tough, he's tough.  He's best in the business.  That's why he is who he is.  He's such a smart player and he knows how to get his shot, and his team looks for him and they got a good rhythm, and they don't have to run plays or anything.  They're just playing basketball.  So you can't relax, you can't have any lapses.  And their help side's got to be good and your trap's got to be good.","Player"
865,2019-06-02,"Fred VanVleet","Postgame","Golden State Win","FRED VANVLEET: Personally, no, I didn't.  But obviously I have a different role than some of the other guys.  I ended up with 38 minutes but that's probably more of an anomaly than anything.","Player"
866,2019-06-02,"Fred VanVleet","Postgame","Golden State Win","FRED VANVLEET: Yeah, we're good.  You guys didn't think this was going to be a sweep, I don't know like what you guys thought this series was going to look like, but we went into it expecting a dog fight.  And, yes, we won Game 1, I think everybody else outside of our locker room was a lot more excited than we were.  We understand what this team brings and what type of effort it's going to take to beat these guys.","Player"
867,2019-06-02,"Fred VanVleet","Postgame","Golden State Win","FRED VANVLEET: Thank you.","Player"
868,2019-06-02,"Nick Nurse","Postgame","Golden State Win","NICK NURSE: A little bit.  I just think we had a few guys in foul trouble kind of early and first half and then third quarter as well and then the fourth quarter.  So I don't know, you got to play physical basketball but you got to be able to adjust and all those kind of things and try to stay out of it, and you got to avoid the silly ones too.  That's all I got","Coach"
869,2019-06-02,"Nick Nurse","Postgame","Golden State Win","NICK NURSE: Well, I got to look at them.  I know, one, he's a great charge-taker, right, and I know one of them was possibly a charge, block/charge and those are tough, they go each way.  But maybe that sixth one, I didn't really see it in the game.  So in the back court, probably 80 feet or so from the basket, those are ones you got to be careful, especially when you got five.  But I'll need to look at that first","Coach"
870,2019-06-02,"Nick Nurse","Postgame","Golden State Win","NICK NURSE: Yeah, I'm certainly going to have to look at it, and I've always said even this series and the last series that offense is really important, taking care of the ball and scoring it because if you don't, they're coming at you really fast the other way.  And again, we have got to be able to get our defense set up, and it's a lot harder when you're not taking care of it or scoring.","Coach"
871,2019-06-02,"Nick Nurse","Postgame","Golden State Win","NICK NURSE: Yeah, he played a lot.  What did he play tonight","Coach"
872,2019-06-02,"Nick Nurse","Postgame","Golden State Win","NICK NURSE: Almost 40.  Yeah, he was good.  Obviously he's working really hard on defense, too, guarding Curry.  He was running the team, he was making really quick decisions off the pick-and-roll.  He had some good looks, he probably hadn't played that many straight minutes in a while.  I think he had a couple there late and he was probably a little tired, but he kept taking them and stepping into them.  But 17 points from him is great and running the team the way he did is great","Coach"
873,2019-06-02,"Nick Nurse","Postgame","Golden State Win","NICK NURSE: Well, they were obviously a little more aggressive and up in us a little bit, but again I think we have got to -- I thought we were just a little bit impatient and didn't hold enough composure just to either, A, get to a strong shot or, B, move it to the next one.  I thought we hit an action and something would be there and they would cover it up with some help defense.  Well, when there's help, there's got to be somebody else probably open on the other side of the floor, and I thought we kind of shot a few too many into multiple defenders or two defenders around the basket, where those probably should have been maybe swung to the other side.","Coach"
874,2019-06-02,"Nick Nurse","Postgame","Golden State Win","NICK NURSE: Yeah, I mean, obviously you got to get up on those guys flying off the screens, Curry and Thompson.  And they did a really good job of getting out of there with speed tonight, those guys getting downhill.  And again a lot of those were just probably mistakes by us, weak-side mistakes or just a half step too slow.  The other night we got away with a few of those where we were a half step too slow, but we would kind of somehow recover out of them.","Coach"
875,2019-06-02,"Nick Nurse","Postgame","Golden State Win","NICK NURSE: Well, I was feeling really good because we stopped their scoring, right, and finally got something figured out there to slow them down.  And we were getting a bunch of wide-open shots, I think we missed three wide-open threes in a row there to cut it to maybe four, right, and maybe it was five.  I don't know what exactly what it was, but a bunch of stops in a row and we didn't get much to show for it at the other end.","Coach"
876,2019-06-02,"Nick Nurse","Postgame","Golden State Win","NICK NURSE: Yeah, I mean, we're in the same boat they kind of were in coming here.  We got to go out there and get one, right, that's all we got to do is get one.  And we can do that","Coach"
877,2019-06-02,"Nick Nurse","Postgame","Golden State Win","NICK NURSE: Yeah, I mean, first of all, our half-court defense is -- first of all, it's about getting it set up.  There was a lot of quick possessions by them, again, probably due to our offense, so that's the first thing.","Coach"
878,2019-06-02,"Nick Nurse","Postgame","Golden State Win","NICK NURSE: Yeah, I think we scored the basket and I look up and there's 26.4 or something left, that's a definite foul situation, right.  They could hold it all the way to the end, throw it up there, hit the rim and the horn's going to go off.  I've been in that situation before.  So usually under 28, if there's 28 or more you're going to play solid defense, if it's 27.9 or under you're not.","Coach"
879,2019-06-02,"Nick Nurse","Postgame","Golden State Win","NICK NURSE: Well, we weren't disrespecting anybody.  We were up guarding hard, and we put two on Steph and he almost threw it right to Kawhi, right?  It was pretty good defense, they were scrambling around, running around like crazy.  And they found Iggy, right, and they found him and like I said, if he's going to take that and give us a chance to get the ball back and win the game, we're going to probably live with that.  It wasn't like we were disrespecting him and not trying to guard him.  We were in a trap and rotating out of there, and again, I would like to go back and try that again about ten times, and see if one of them doesn't go our way.","Coach"
880,2019-06-02,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: Yeah, he is going to be activated tonight.  I don't know if that changes things much.  I think it's been a long time since he's played.  He has been pretty active here in the last four, five days, though, as far as getting up and down the floor and things.  He has lost quite a bit of weight as well.  So there's that and there's the timing.","Coach"
881,2019-06-02,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: Probably.  Well, depends how it goes.  I usually think when a guy is off for a long time, I would say to him it's probably going to be a three- or four-minute burst because I think that that's probably with the speed, the way the game's moving at this stage of the season, what they could handle.","Coach"
882,2019-06-02,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: Yeah, in Game 1 he took a few that we need to do better.  He was the first one down the floor and they ran a big down.  Our bigs just weren't getting down there quick enough to kind of do the exchange back, and they threw it long.  He's valuing every possession.  So he grabbed them so they wouldn't just lay it in.  We need to protect him a little bit better as well.","Coach"
883,2019-06-02,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: Yeah, a hundred percent.  He's running the show, really.  It's his area.  He's our director of sports science, which means he oversees all the health fitness and training and injury prevention and injury-taking-care-of and stuff like that.  So it's totally his call.  He tells me who is ready to go and when.  That's totally -- I turn that over to him.  As you know, he's got a lot of experience, a lot of championships under his belt.","Coach"
884,2019-06-02,"Kawhi Leonard","Postgame","Golden State Win","KAWHI LEONARD: I mean, you pretty much summed it up right there.  We ended up trapping Curry, I was playing 2, he ended up passing to Livingston, almost got a steal, and then I mean, I really didn't see where Iggy came from.  He came up, Livingston found him and he knocked down a shot, a big shot","Player"

Obviously on somebody else's home floor, they got the sixth man with the crowd, but just have to buy into ourselves and come out hard, strong, no mistake, no turnovers, and same thing you got to do at home","Player"
887,2019-06-02,"Kawhi Leonard","Postgame","Golden State Win","KAWHI LEONARD: I mean, I never thought of it, really, but I guess it feels good, but it's not over yet.  Still basketball, no matter what jersey you got on.  And that's what I'm trying to do, just lead and win games","Player"
888,2019-06-02,"Kawhi Leonard","Postgame","Golden State Win","KAWHI LEONARD: Oh, I feel like in that third quarter, we didn't score the ball in like the first five minutes, four and a half minutes, obviously led to them getting out in transition early and a lot of layups and open looks, and that was pretty much the game right there.  Went on like a 15, 18-0 run, I believe, and you can't do that with a championship team on the other side","Player"
889,2019-06-02,"Kawhi Leonard","Postgame","Golden State Win","KAWHI LEONARD: I mean, I can't say that.  I mean, I feel like our pace was good early, it was just that third quarter, I feel like it just really killed us.  18-0 run, if we can't score no baskets, you're not going to win no game","Player"
890,2019-06-02,"Kawhi Leonard","Postgame","Golden State Win","KAWHI LEONARD: Not really.  I mean, we still got to go out and make shots and guard guys that's out there.  Everybody's in the NBA, these guys have a high basketball ","Player"
891,2019-06-02,"Kawhi Leonard","Postgame","Golden State Win","KAWHI LEONARD: Obviously just take it one game at a time.  Finals is not going to be easy.  The only thing that matters is the four.  Four wins.  Once you get it, two wins, three wings, it does not matter.  Just take one game at a time and just play through the adversity","Player"

893,2019-06-02,"Frank Layden","Pregame","N/A","FRANK LAYDEN: Let me say this, Chuck and I, as I say, went way back.  I don't know if people realize it, but Chuck actually when he started college went to our arch rival of Niagara's was St. Bonaventure.  He lived up I guess in western Pennsylvania or up in near Olean, New York.  So I didn't know him exactly at that time, but it was a conversation piece, and we got to know each other through the years.  I remember, I first really spent some time with him when him and Hubie Brown were assistant coaches at Duke and saw him later on when he was an assistant at Penn and Niagara played in the NCAA's and what have you.","Player"
894,2019-06-02,"Frank Layden","Pregame","N/A","FRANK LAYDEN: I never got the itch to coach, I never missed coaching, I missed playing.  I loved basketball, I loved to play basketball and I played it as long as I could and on playgrounds and what have you.  I was a gym rat and what have you.  But coaching is a profession, it's teaching.  The game itself is merely a tool.  My most effective coaching times in my life was when I was a high school coach.  When I could get into the hearts and minds and souls of those youngsters and maybe guide them for the rest of their lives.  That was really important.","Player"
895,2019-06-02,"Frank Layden","Pregame","N/A","RICK CARLISLE: Tremendous.  Tremendous.  Steve is -- a run of five consecutive Finals is just an amazing accomplishment, regardless of the talent.  And I've watched Nick closely, we played against him twice this year.  He's terrific in making adjustments and I love the way he's approached the entire season, they have set up the entire season to work to get to this point and for a first-time NBA head coach, that's not easy to do.","Player"
896,2019-06-02,"Frank Layden","Pregame","N/A","FRANK LAYDEN: I just met Steve for the first time outside and we hugged each other and he said, ""It's such an honor and a pleasure to meet you,"" meaning me.  And I said to him, ""You know, Steve, are you having fun?""  He said, ""Yes, I am.""  I said, ""Then continue to do it as long as you are, continue to do it the way you're doing it, never forget where you came from, and enjoy the ride.""  No matter who you are, whether you're Red Auerbach or Steve Kerr or anybody else, Pat Riley, basketball's temporary.  The games are temporary, sooner or later it comes to an end and you want to leave a legacy, that's important.","Player"

You know what I like about the team here?  They play hard.  I don't know if they can win, I don't know if they're better, I don't want to measure them by that, but they just went through a long schedule and had the best record, didn't they?  That's why they're here tonight and not somewhere else.  So I mean, so far, oh, he's done a wonderful job.  He's done a great job.","Player"

901,2019-06-02,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Golden State Win","STEVE KERR: Not really.  Klay said he'll be fine, but Klay could be half dead and he would say he would be fine.  We'll see.  He pulled his hamstring.  He thinks it is minor, so I don't know what that means going forward.","Coach"
902,2019-06-02,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Golden State Win","STEVE KERR: Well, I said yesterday and today that 109 points is plenty to win the game, which is what we had in Game 1, but we gave up 118.  So it was all about our defense and we held them to 37 percent and forced 15 turnovers and guarded the three-point line well.  So it was championship defense and that's what it's going to take","Coach"
903,2019-06-02,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Golden State Win","STEVE KERR: He was great.  We came in thinking, all right, he can maybe play 20 minutes and he gave us almost 28.  There was only one time in the game when he needed a rest, which was mid-fourth and we gave him a couple minutes and then got him back in the game.  But he was fantastic and we needed everything he gave out there, his rebounding, his toughness, his physical presence, getting the ball in the paint, and just playing big, like he does.  We needed all of that.","Coach"
904,2019-06-02,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Golden State Win","STEVE KERR: Yeah, I mean, it was the big point in the game.  I thought just staying in the game at the end of the second quarter was also very important.  I think we were down 12 and the place was going nuts, we couldn't score, and Steph and Klay both got loose and the game loosened up a little bit and we scored.  We weren't exactly making stops, but we cut the lead to five and could kind of breathe at halftime.","Coach"
905,2019-06-02,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Golden State Win","STEVE KERR: Yeah, I mean, I couldn't have envisioned 14-0, but I liked our position.  It felt lake we should have been down by a lot more than five.  For the first quarter and a half we really had a tough time scoring.  So the last whatever it was, four, five, six minutes, the game loosened up and we finally broke free and started getting some buckets.  We started to look like ourselves and so at that point it just felt better and then the second half we got it rolling and we ended up with 34 assists, which is more like our team.","Coach"
906,2019-06-02,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Golden State Win","STEVE KERR: Well, you're not going to let Steph Curry take the shot, so they double-teamed Steph and that left Andre open, and he had hit another big one earlier in the game.","Coach"
907,2019-06-02,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Golden State Win","STEVE KERR: Just wanted to change the look.  Both teams have a lot of versatility defensively and both teams have been kind of switching matchups and changing the look, and we felt at halftime like it made some sense.  So we went with it and whether that was it or not, I mean, we just got into a good groove defensively to start that third quarter.","Coach"
908,2019-06-02,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Golden State Win","STEVE KERR: From DeMarcus?  Yeah, he feels good in there right now and we have a couple days before Game 3, so we do feel confident that we can continue to get good minutes from him.  We're going to need them, obviously, with all these injuries","Coach"
909,2019-06-02,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Golden State Win","STEVE KERR: I think he may have been a little dehydrated and that was the word I got.  He just was feeling a little bit lightheaded and went back into the training room and came back and was doing much better.  So I'm not exactly sure beyond that.  So that's all I've got for you","Coach"
910,2019-06-02,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Golden State Win","STEVE KERR: Well, that's what it takes.  You need your bench, no matter what, but in particular when you've got a lot of injuries.  So we'll just continue to go to those guys and trust them, and they have proven that they can really help us.  Bogut hadn't played in the first game and three quarters, so what he did was fantastic out there.  It gave us a little different look with that lob threat, so we'll just see what we have got and tee it up for Game 3","Coach"
911,2019-06-02,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Golden State Win","STEVE KERR: He's just got a lot of experience, he's done everything in his career, he's been in the Olympics, he's won three rings, he's been an All-Star, he knows how to play, one of the smartest players I've ever been around.  I think he sensed that we needed his production in that second half and he came alive.","Coach"
912,2019-06-02,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: I guess every situation is unique and different.  I think what's unique about our team is that these guys all play so dramatically differently in terms of the way they approach the game.  Draymond is such a versatile defender and a guy who pushes the ball in transition.  Klay one of the best on-ball defenders in the game and a great shooter.  Steph, on- and off-ball wizardry.  They all complement each other so well and they basically come up together.  They're pretty close in age.  And get along well. They love playing together.  And yeah, they complement each other and have grown and been through a lot of things together.  So the bonds have only grown stronger","Coach"
913,2019-06-02,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: Yeah, I think so.  When you haven't been through it before as a group, there's an unknown that you have to account for and you have to sort of take a leap of faith with each decision that you make, each move that you make.  You have to trust each other, not having the history behind you to really have earned that trust.  So you're really trying to grow together.","Coach"
914,2019-06-02,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: It's much different without Kevin.  Each guy in that lineup has to take on a different role.  So you think about who would replace Kevin in that lineup and you've got your options and your alternatives.  But we have obviously felt that other lineups make more sense, so that's why we do a different direction","Coach"
915,2019-06-02,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: Actually, I wasn't aware that he was coming until a little while ago.  The shirt has everything to do with the tragedy in Virginia Beach a couple days ago, and how devastated so many families are and so many people are.  The shirt is a reminder that the only way we can get out of this mess is to actually vote, and to vote for people who are going to be willing to create some change in our gun laws in our country.","Coach"
916,2019-06-02,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: He's been limited in practice the last couple days, but it's been mostly kind of walkthrough stuff anyway.  He's going to start and he'll play.  We have just kind of held him out of most of the drill work just to be cautious, but he's ready to go","Coach"
917,2019-06-02,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: Yeah, it's always tougher for big guys.  The game moves faster for them when they return from an injury.  It takes a little longer to adjust.  But I thought he played well the other night.  Eight minutes -- he generated some points for us, made a couple steals.  He was effective.  We will look at different possibilities, different matchups. You could see him a little bit more tonight","Coach"
918,2019-06-02,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: I saw the second half.  We were practicing during the first half.  So I was pleased with the result","Coach"
919,2019-06-02,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: Well, I'm not an expert, so I can't offer an expert analysis, but my novice analysis was it was not a particularly well-played game.  But again, the result was the desired one for Liverpool fans.  It reminded me of our Game 1.  We had nine, 10 days off; they had almost three weeks off.  Everybody on both sides looked a little rusty, and our Game 1 felt that way.  When you've been off for a little bit, you lose your edge and you're just not as sharp.  So hopefully tonight we'll be sharper","Coach"
920,2019-06-02,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: Well, the White house visit, for sure, after the 2015 championship.  That was quite a thrill to visit there and have the whole team there.  It's a treat to experience that.","Coach"
921,2019-06-02,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: Thank you.","Coach"
922,2019-06-02,"Draymond Green","Postgame","Golden State Win","DRAYMOND GREEN: Yeah, just tried to be more aggressive.  I wanted to set a tone on him and not let him get in rhythm early.  In saying that I didn't box-and-one him or chase him around the floor, like Richard Sherman does, some guys like.  That's a complete team effort.  I tried to do my job when I was on him and everybody else stepped in and did their job as well.  I think getting back in transition was huge, but overall we threw several different bodies at him.","Player"
923,2019-06-02,"Draymond Green","Postgame","Golden State Win","DRAYMOND GREEN: We got stops.  We took away their transition buckets and we got transition buckets.  We always say we're at our best when we're -- that's our best offense when we're getting stops and we're pushing the ball.","Player"
924,2019-06-02,"Draymond Green","Postgame","Golden State Win","DRAYMOND GREEN: He did.  Once again, DeMarcus hasn't played much basketball over the course of the last 18 months.  So the more he plays, the better feel he gets.  Tonight he was huge for us.  Putting him in the starting lineup I think it was big.  Obviously they want to attack him on the defensive end, but you watch the film, he didn't give up much on the defensive end in Game 1.  Similar to tonight, he was great on both ends as well.  So it allowed us to play through him some in the post.  They got to honor that or we know what he's capable of if they don't","Player"
925,2019-06-02,"Draymond Green","Postgame","Golden State Win","DRAYMOND GREEN: Well, I didn't think they were going to foul.  They were trying to get a steal.  They were trapping Steph.  Steph outlet the ball with me, they came with the trap.  But I think that as big as Andre's shot was, we have come to expect on Andre to hit big shots.  Since he's been here I've seen him hit several game winners.  I've seen him put the icing on the cake at several wins.","Player"
926,2019-06-02,"Draymond Green","Postgame","Golden State Win","DRAYMOND GREEN: We're always going to make mistakes.  That's just the nature of the game we play.  You're playing against a great team.  They're in the NBA Finals for a reason, they're going to force you to make some mistakes.  It's about the effort that you put out there on the floor to overcome those mistakes.  I think we did that tonight.","Player"
927,2019-06-02,"Draymond Green","Postgame","Golden State Win","DRAYMOND GREEN: We were down five at half","Player"
928,2019-06-02,"Draymond Green","Postgame","Golden State Win","DRAYMOND GREEN: Oh yeah, yeah","Player"
929,2019-06-02,"Draymond Green","Postgame","Golden State Win","DRAYMOND GREEN: I thought if we kept it up, it would turn around because when they went on their run, I think they went up 12, we had three or four possessions where we got great shots and we just missed them.  I have faith in our team that if we continue to -- we always talk about just getting a shot every time.  We're good enough to where if we get a shot every time, we're going to give ourselves a chance to win.","Player"
930,2019-06-02,"Draymond Green","Postgame","Golden State Win","DRAYMOND GREEN: I enjoy it a lot.  Guarding Kawhi's different than guarding Pascal, and guarding Pascal is different than guarding Kyle Lowry.  But as a defender, as a competitor I relish those opportunities to make an impact on the game, on the defensive side of the basketball.  I understand how important that side of the basketball is and no matter who I'm on, I try to make sure I have a big impact on that side.","Player"
931,2019-06-02,"Stephen Curry","Postgame","Golden State Win","DeMARCUS COUSINS: It feels great.  I've leaned on my teammates throughout this moment and throughout this whole process and this was an incredible moment for me.  But I'm not satisfied and I'm looking forward to Game 3","Player"
932,2019-06-02,"Stephen Curry","Postgame","Golden State Win","STEPHEN CURRY: He was special.  Obviously you get more comfortable, more minutes and playing aggressive when he's out there, puts a lot of pressure on their defense.  And even on our defensive end, making his presence felt blocking shots, being in the right place at the right time.  It's a big lift for us.  I know he's been waiting a long time to be on this stage.  Obviously with his injuries, he's taken the challenge of inserting himself and making that transition smooth.  So it's been fun to watch.  More to come","Player"
933,2019-06-02,"Stephen Curry","Postgame","Golden State Win","DeMARCUS COUSINS: I was just like, cool.  I mean, I told Steve coming into this whatever he needed from me, I was okay with.  If it's coming off the bench, if it's starting, if it's playing eight minutes or 40, I'm cool with whatever.  So I just want to come in and help the team with whatever's needed.  When I step on the floor, I'm going to leave it out there","Player"
934,2019-06-02,"Stephen Curry","Postgame","Golden State Win","DeMARCUS COUSINS: One, I want to be on this stage.  This is what I've worked for my entire career, to be on this stage, to have this opportunity to play for something.  But once they told me I had a chance, a slight chance, of being able to return, it basically was up to me and the work and the time I put in behind the injury, it was up to me.  So I put the work in and the time in and with God's grace I'm able to be out here and play the game that I love.","Player"
935,2019-06-02,"Stephen Curry","Postgame","Golden State Win","STEPHEN CURRY: Yeah, I think that when you get to this stage like who -- our DNA shows up, so it's not something you just throw out there to have nice shirts and give out to the crowd at Oracle and have all this marketing stuff.  It's literally how we approach every day from training camp to June, how we support each other, how guys stay ready throughout the year, whether they play like he said, 30 minutes or miss 10 straight games out of the rotation, whatever it is.","Player"
936,2019-06-02,"Stephen Curry","Postgame","Golden State Win","STEPHEN CURRY: Just didn't feel right, but at the start of the game, but at the end of the day nothing's going to keep you out from playing in the Finals game, if you can help it.  So I have plenty of time to recover before Game 3.  Don't really know what the cause was, just didn't feel right","Player"
937,2019-06-02,"Stephen Curry","Postgame","Golden State Win","STEPHEN CURRY: It pretty much won us the game because we established our defensive presence, we got stops and everybody got involved in the offensive end.  And when you come to the timeout after a couple runs like that and everybody's involved, whether they're scoring or setting screens or making the assist or whatever the case is, everybody feels good and the vibe is just solid, and we know that we have taken control of the momentum and then it's just about sustaining it down the stretch.","Player"

941,2019-06-01,"Fred VanVleet","Practice","N/A","FRED VANVLEET: It's big.  That's been probably our most consistent theme this year: trying to be really great in transition defense, and then just let our talent flow on transition offense.  we get our defense set, we like our chances.  We get the rebound and push, obviously some easy buckets.  At this time of year defenses are so good, the coaching and schemes are so good, that if you can get an advantage in transition, steal a couple buckets and win that advantage, I think that's a huge key for the game","Player"
942,2019-06-01,"Fred VanVleet","Practice","N/A","FRED VANVLEET: I don't know.  I never thought of it like that.  Obviously, we all have our own identities.  I think that they were kind of revolutionary for the game, with the way that they built their team.  And Draymond obviously being a big key to that.  He was one of the guys to do it on the highest level for a long time.  We got Pascal, who can push.  Marc can handle.  And it's just positionless basketball where you have multiple playmakers out there.  Guys who can make reads, make plays, push the ball.  We're just running and trying to get easy ones.","Player"
943,2019-06-01,"Fred VanVleet","Practice","N/A","FRED VANVLEET: It's funny, because I hate our rims.  I hate our rims.  But, no, we got a special thing going.  I think that it's just kind of the aura and the magic in the air. You can feel it a little bit.  We have a lot to do with that.  Our fans have a lot to do with that.  Things are just going the right way for us.  So as many shots as I missed in the last few weeks, that toilet bowl shot I had is probably due to go in.  And if one of your favorite great players makes that shot, he's a great player.  And when I make it, I'm lucky.  So I'll take it.  It went in and we move on","Player"
944,2019-06-01,"Fred VanVleet","Practice","N/A","FRED VANVLEET: It hit the backboard, at least.  I knew that as soon as I let go.  It swam around there three or four times, but I definitely knew I hit the backboard","Player"

947,2019-06-01,"Fred VanVleet","Practice","N/A","FRED VANVLEET: Yeah, I missed that.  I don't know.  At some point in your career, the crowd just becomes one big noise and one sea of people.  Obviously, I appreciate it, but I was probably so locked in, I didn't even notice it","Player"
948,2019-06-01,"Fred VanVleet","Practice","N/A","FRED VANVLEET: Yeah, it's got to be at a high level.  You have to communicate at a high level.  We're talking schemes.  We're talking coverages.  We're talking where to help, where the help's coming from.  And the most important communication comes in the downtime -- the free throws and the timeouts and the dead balls -- and just figuring out what we're going to do next.  The rest is kind of instinctual.  But for the most part, once you get that stuff set, it's mostly instinctual and just knowing where you're going to go.  You've already walked through it or talked through it or whatever the case may be and you just try to keep building on that","Player"
949,2019-06-01,"Fred VanVleet","Practice","N/A","FRED VANVLEET: Yes, this is one of the best teams I've been on defensively from a communication standpoint.  I think that just having the open-floor dialogue helps.  No guy is right or wrong.  We just want to come up with the right answer.  And as long as we're all on the same page, most of the time you can figure it out after that","Player"
950,2019-06-01,"Fred VanVleet","Practice","N/A","FRED VANVLEET: OG, he's great.  He's got that great frame, great body, and obviously we could use him on the glass.  We could use him cutting and slashing, making open threes. Having another body out there to defend, and get in the way of some of their guys.","Player"
951,2019-06-01,"Klay Thompson","Practice","N/A","KLAY THOMPSON: Confidence is obviously big in anything you do, any profession you're in. It starts with our leader in Steph Curry, who is probably -- you just see it in his game, his ability to pull up from 35 feet anywhere on the floor.  Draymond as well, who plays with great passion and confidence.  When the best guys on your team do that, it trickles down.  You need that, especially in this industry.  You can't go out there and doubt yourself, especially on this stage.  Especially when you have a proven track record of winning and great team chemistry and all that.","Player"
952,2019-06-01,"Klay Thompson","Practice","N/A","KLAY THOMPSON: It's much different.  They don't play as much one-on-one as the past couple rounds.  Kawhi is great at it, but they really move the ball well and they always try to find that extra man.  So our defensive rotations have to be a little tighter, a little faster tomorrow, because we gave them too many naked looks [in Game 1]","Player"
953,2019-06-01,"Klay Thompson","Practice","N/A","KLAY THOMPSON: Yeah, so I'll have to adjust and be a helper and be better rotating, because I left too many guys open [in Game 1].  Can't give NBA players wide-open shots.  They will knock those down","Player"
954,2019-06-01,"Klay Thompson","Practice","N/A","KLAY THOMPSON: Probably a combination of both.  Give them credit.  Siakam was running the floor like a gazelle.  They were getting the ball off the rim and just pushing it. Instead of crashing as hard as we did, we'll have to make the adjustment in Game 2 and try to send more guys back.","Player"
955,2019-06-01,"Klay Thompson","Practice","N/A","But 10 days off as well, we might have had a little cobwebs.  It was just a mixture of things.  But I know this: I know we'll be better tomorrow.  So that's always a good thing","Player"
956,2019-06-01,"Klay Thompson","Practice","N/A","KLAY THOMPSON: Yes.  A hundred percent.  It's first to four, not first to one.  So still a lot of basketball to be played","Player"
957,2019-06-01,"Klay Thompson","Practice","N/A","KLAY THOMPSON: He's been a great teammate for eight years.  Even a better friend.  You root for guys like Steph because he doesn't take any shortcuts.  He works extremely hard.","Player"
958,2019-06-01,"Klay Thompson","Practice","N/A","KLAY THOMPSON: Yeah, it's pretty cool","Player"
959,2019-06-01,"Klay Thompson","Practice","N/A","KLAY THOMPSON: I'm not sure, but they're very good.  They're very long.  They don't really play with a traditional post player, which is kind of similar.  They really spread you out.  The biggest difference between other teams?  I mean, probably their size.  They're really big.  Their big men can handle the ball and make plays too.  So that's very similar.  Every position player on the floor can make a play.  When you have playmakers everywhere, it's hard to guard","Player"
960,2019-06-01,"Klay Thompson","Practice","N/A","KLAY THOMPSON: Takes a lot.  Takes a lot of patience as well.  You just have to know when to use your energy.  You don't want to be sprinting around the whole time, but you have just years of knowing how to rub your man off a screen or familiarity with the offense we're in.  It's really an inexact science, but just to keep it simple.  Go where the defense isn't and make a decision from there, whether it's rise up and shoot, hit your teammate.","Player"
961,2019-06-01,"Klay Thompson","Practice","N/A","KLAY THOMPSON: Can't give him those open threes.  He turned himself into a very good three-point shooter.  That was a big difference in the game the other day; his 20 points were huge for them.  He's a great passer, always has been, since he's been in the league.  Very good defender at the rim.  Obviously, that pickup turned out to be huge for them.","Player"
962,2019-06-01,"Klay Thompson","Practice","N/A","KLAY THOMPSON: Yes, but I can't say it because I don't want to tell how we're going to attack him on defense.  That's not smart","Player"
963,2019-06-01,"Klay Thompson","Practice","N/A","KLAY THOMPSON: What did I dislike?  I don't think we were flying around defensively like we usually were.  I don't know if that was a combination of 10 days off or complacency or just not expecting them to make those open shots.  We weren't enforcing our will like we usually do.  We have to take that challenge tomorrow, and it starts on the defensive end.  Offense will come, but we have to limit them in transition and just make them work for everything, instead of just giving them wide-open looks.  If we take those away, make them beat us over the top, one-on-one situations, we'll give ourselves a chance to win the ball game and it will be a much closer game and probably an uglier game.  But like I said, better opportunity for us to win.","Player"
964,2019-06-01,"Pascal Siakam","Practice","N/A","PASCAL SIAKAM: Definitely it's something that we try to do.  We have the opportunity to be in transition and we definitely are a team that likes to run in transition, so that's definitely something good for us","Player"
965,2019-06-01,"Pascal Siakam","Practice","N/A","PASCAL SIAKAM: No, I never -- I don't think like that.  I just go out there.  I think, I always felt like every time I'm out there I can always use -- I mean, when you play with a guy like Kawhi, you know he's going to get attention and you're going to have opportunities, and I think for me I didn't really think of specific matchups.  I just think about going out there and whatever matchup is out there, just using whatever I can to my abilities, and try to find a way to score and impact the game","Player"
966,2019-06-01,"Pascal Siakam","Practice","N/A","PASCAL SIAKAM: Well, I think that obviously they're going to come out with more pop and energy.  After losing Game 1, we definitely expect them to have a lot more.  So definitely have to -- I think we have to be ourselves, continue to play our game, obviously we made some little mistakes on defense that we thought that we could correct on our own, and just continue to be ourselves and try to go out and do what we did better, and whatever energy that comes our way, we have to have better energy","Player"
967,2019-06-01,"Pascal Siakam","Practice","N/A","PASCAL SIAKAM: I think that we know it's a series and I think having guys that have been through it and know what it's like, and us also being down every single series, I mean, for the most part until now, we know what it takes to win and how important it is to -- if have you a lead, the other team's going to come down, they're going to make adjustments, they're going to come at you.","Player"
968,2019-06-01,"Pascal Siakam","Practice","N/A","PASCAL SIAKAM: I think that's what the NBA's about, I think it's about opportunities and guys coming from different places and all coming to compete at this level and the G League's part of that, having guys that really didn't even think that they were going to be here, or they had a different path or a rough path and to go through the G League and find a way to the league.  It's definitely something awesome, and I think for me being, having to go to the G League and play there definitely helped me","Player"
969,2019-06-01,"Pascal Siakam","Practice","N/A","PASCAL SIAKAM: No","Player"
970,2019-06-01,"Pascal Siakam","Practice","N/A","PASCAL SIAKAM: No","Player"
971,2019-06-01,"Pascal Siakam","Practice","N/A","PASCAL SIAKAM: I think we are a really deep team, and I think from any single night guys can show up and guys can definitely step up.  I mean, I don't know exactly how many, what my percentage needs to be for us to win, but I know that if we all come out and have that same energy and mindset to attack and whoever steps up, as long as we win we're good.","Player"
972,2019-06-01,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: No would be the answer to both those questions.  They were in a coverage the other night I had never seen before, which was a switch to a late blitz.  It was pretty interesting.  I had never seen it before and it was innovative.  They do a lot of innovative stuff.  So I would say that they probably got other things we haven't seen that we're going to have to adjust to on the fly.  I'm probably never surprised that he gets blitzed as much as he does","Coach"
973,2019-06-01,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: Yeah, for the most part.  I think we made pretty good decisions.  There are always some things you probably would have -- other outlets you would have went to on some of those offensive deals.  There's other spacing you would have done, other cuts you might have made.","Coach"
974,2019-06-01,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: You're always concerned with him.  I think he's certainly a low-post force.  It's hard to guard him with one guy when they decide to throw it in there to him and he gets going.  And then when he's playing on the perimeter, he can do both things:  He's a very good passer and he can also knock down a shot if you don't go up and guard him.","Coach"
975,2019-06-01,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: Yeah, I think we have some veteran guys that have seen a lot and played in a lot of games.  I always talk about him: He's not only played in a lot of big NBA games, but he's played on the international stage at the highest level.  I think he has a couple silver medals under his belt or something like that.","Coach"
976,2019-06-01,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: Well, there were several of them.  You just have to not get lulled into getting back into the open space.  It's like you think it's a switch and not a blitz and you start playing your switch offense, and then all of a sudden it turns into a blitz offense.  So you have to leave your switch offense and go to your blitz offense.","Coach"
977,2019-06-01,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: Yeah, I don't think the leg trouble is much of an issue.  And I'm expecting him to play a lot better tomorrow","Coach"
978,2019-06-01,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: We use a term ""keep playing"" on offense.  That means that we don't like to react a lot of times to switches.  When there's a switch made, as I mentioned, we have a switch offense that we play.  But a lot of it is to just keep playing, and not let a switch stop your offense and try to overanalyze a mismatch or bog down and wait 10 seconds to try to post feed against a smaller guy or whatever, because all it does is send you into a low-shot clock situation, which are low-percentage situations.  We like to just keep playing.","Coach"
979,2019-06-01,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: I call him a transformational player.  He's got kids all over the world shooting from 40 feet away.  I think even as you've seen the three-point shot become so rapidly used in the last three or four years, a lot of that is because of Golden State and Steph and Klay and some of the other guys, KD, the other guys they have.","Coach"
980,2019-06-01,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: Marc is pretty easy to get along with.  He's like one of those guys that's just a true professional.  He goes about his business.  He does his thing and gets in, gets out.  He blends in well.  He fits in well.  He's just an easygoing guy, so it's a lot easier.  It's really easy to have a conversation with him and talk to him.  He just gets on the plane and watches his film and talks about boating and does his thing","Player"
981,2019-06-01,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: I mean, it's pretty crazy that it's a team that everyone just kind of is staying the same way.  We have been preaching it all year, so it kind of just became contagious.  Most guys' personalities are just be even-keeled off the court.  On the court, we've got some fiery guys.  But off the floor we have some grown men, people with families and kids.  They understand that their profession is their lives.  That's what they do: They take care of their families, their friends, their bodies.  They're a professional","Player"
982,2019-06-01,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: Pat is a champion.  I knew he would be able to step up to any task that he had at hand.  He didn't play in the Milwaukee series.  He wasn't around for personal reasons.  But he's back and I would never doubt him a moment stepping on that floor.  I knew he would go out there and do his job and play hard.  He made a huge three for us.  Like I said, if he gets an opportunity to play, he's going to help us always","Player"
983,2019-06-01,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: No","Player"
984,2019-06-01,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: We have some professionals on our team and they know their jobs.  They want to be professionals and they are professional.  So it's about doing their job and being able to just adapt on the fly","Player"
985,2019-06-01,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: They got rings.  They got rings and they can be confident.  We can't really necessarily worry about them.  We have to continue to worry about us.  They're going to be them and they're going to do their thing, but for us we have to concentrate on us and focus on what we have to do.  We can't worry about this, that.  We go out there and we do our game plan and we focus on what we can control.  That's what we have done all year.  We haven't worried about this, that and the other, in the sense of we go out there and we control what we can control on our end.  We play against a team that we're going to play against, but we have to do our job","Player"
986,2019-06-01,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: Yeah, it was definitely a difference.  It was a Game 1 of the Finals.  They were unbelievable.  They were electric","Player"
987,2019-06-01,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: We need our fans.  We'd love them to be there and we want them to be loud and we want them to be just supporting us, and we're happy that they're there.  We still have to go out there and put the ball in the hole and play defense but, yeah, we loved it","Player"
988,2019-06-01,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: When I first got traded here I didn't really know what to expect.  I thought it I would be here a couple years and be out of here.  But the organization is unbelievable, the ownership is unbelievable, management has been great.  We have had great people come through here, players, coaches, and just kind of grown for me.  I been here now seven years, my kids are in school here.  So it's kind of -- it's a situation where I've been home, I call it ""home"" because I'm here nine, ten months out of the year.","Player"
989,2019-06-01,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: Keep the same energy.  We appreciate it","Player"
990,2019-06-01,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: I think the way they're built, they have some guys that can play, they're long, they got length, they know how to play.  They have been playing together a long time, so on defense they kind of do their thing, and if that works for them then -- for us, I think we handled it pretty well.  I think we were patient.  I think Kawhi did a good job of kind of baiting them out a little bit and getting passes off, and letting us play four-on-three and kind of just going out there.","Player"
991,2019-06-01,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: Yeah.  I would be lying to you if I said it didn't.  And also Marc and Danny and Nick.  I think Nick honestly yelled at us twice the whole year.  That's legit: twice the whole year.  And that's a long season to only yell at a team twice.  I think that's just Nick and Kawhi and Marc and Danny -- everyone is just kind of going out there and staying even-keeled.","Player"
992,2019-06-01,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: No, no.  I ain't that guy.  So, no.  No","Player"
993,2019-06-01,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: No, it doesn't.  It doesn't run through my mind.  You pay for it later.  At the moment, as long as you win the game, it's all worth it.  Whatever you have to do to win the basketball game, your body, just throw it out there and whatever happens, happens.  Hopefully you just don't get hurt; you can get up and bounce back and go move on","Player"
994,2019-06-01,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: How many shots you counting?  Because I only counted one that bounced three or four seconds.  That's a long time","Player"
995,2019-06-01,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: What goes through my mind?  Those rims are really soft.  That's what goes through my mind.  As long as they go in, I don't care how they go in.  Happy about it.  Two points, three points or whatever","Player"
996,2019-06-01,"Kyle Lowry","Practice","N/A","KYLE LOWRY: I love all rims.  Thank you.","Player"
997,2019-06-01,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: Yeah, because it's just movement.  You're constantly moving.  You're keeping everybody's head on a swivel.  They create so much space without having the ball. It's not very many people that can do that.  A lot of players in this league, including myself, we create our value based on having the basketball.  Those guys are able to do it off of the ball.  That's kind of what makes us go","Player"
998,2019-06-01,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: We have been here before.  We have seen a lot.  I don't know about all, but we have seen a lot.  So being here, we rely on our experience.  We rely on our pedigree to bring us through in these type of situations.  It's exciting.  It's fun. It's good.  This is a challenge for us.  The only thing to do is to run through it","Player"
999,2019-06-01,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: Yeah, try to set the tone, come out aggressive.  It definitely gets loud in here.  That's going to be a key for Game 2, making sure that we dictate the tone coming out","Player"
1000,2019-06-01,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: Yeah, definitely.  I don't think we have been booed like that coming out for warmups.  And then obviously the double anthem, the guys that were singing -- it was: We are here, it's the Finals.  It's what you expect","Player"
1001,2019-06-01,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: Kawhi Leonard.  Anytime you have a top-five, top-10 player in the league, it automatically makes your team better because of the attention those guys are going to get, their capabilities, how they can create for the rest of the team.  But also, they have good chemistry and it looks like they enjoy playing with each other.  So I think that's kind of the similarities you may see between them and us.","Player"
1002,2019-06-01,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: I appreciate them for their support.  Coming in, I wanted to be able to contribute to the team and be able to get them to this point, and we're doing it so far.  I just feel like I did something special for them, just this group, just being able to be the first team to get to the NBA Finals for Toronto.  that's how fans are.  Everyone out here they love, not just me.  If you walk through the city or if I'm with one of my teammates, they show them a lot of love as well.  it's a great support group out here with the fans and with everyone in Toronto","Player"
1003,2019-06-01,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: In game?  Obviously, you have to ask him that question.  Obviously, I feel like he works on that every day.  He's one of the greatest shooters I've ever seen.","Player"
1004,2019-06-01,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","With shooters like that, that's what it's about: relocating, finding your spot on the floor and getting to it.  He plays with some talented players, smart players that know how to give him the ball in his spots.  He's a crafty player.  He's been here before.  I feel like that's what makes him who he is","Player"
1005,2019-06-01,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: What I like to do is not try to relax.  Stay locked in on him.  Chase him as hard as you can.  Put a hand up and see where it goes from there.  That's pretty much it","Player"
1006,2019-06-01,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: I come into the game just trying to win.  If I have my mindset on just trying to score the ball, yeah, it could be difficult.  But I'm trying to make the right play out there, and obviously if there are two people on me, somebody is open.  I could create a collapse situation.","Player"
1007,2019-06-01,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: Pretty much the group film with the whole team.  We're listening to the coaches.  Also whoever has feedback -- me, Kyle, whoever, Norm, Freddie, Serge.  Whoever has feedback we're listening and preparing for the next game and seeing what we can do better collectively.  From there, just try to watch the game myself, see what positions helped us on both ends of the floor and see what didn't work for us and try to make those mistakes better","Player"
1008,2019-06-01,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: Probably out of everybody who I talk to about film, the most is Kyle.  Me and him will watch film or talk to each other, see what we are seeing on the floor, either for ourselves or positions to make our teammates better","Player"
1009,2019-06-01,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: Probably just growing up playing basketball.  That's all could I say.  Just being in those experiences like you named.  Going through that whole season.  Coming right in as a rookie probably helped me just guarding the best player every night.  Always wanting to win.  Learning from the great teammates that I had then, from Tim [Duncan], Tony [Parker] and Manu [Ginobili].  Seeing how they approached the game -- every game, win, lose, missing a shot, game-winning shot, making a bad mistake.  I guess just growing up, being in these moments before.  If you're playing a championship game in high school, you kind of get the same feeling.","Player"
1010,2019-06-01,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: It really doesn't happen too much.  I really can't say it happens","Player"
1011,2019-06-01,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: I don't think everybody does.  I think it's more paid attention to when I do something good.  The camera will go to me or see what I'm doing at that exact moment.  But when I watch games from past, from Kobe or Shaq or Mike, they always didn't just go nuts.  They made big shots and sometimes they pump their fist and walk back to the bench.  So I just think because I really don't do it a lot, a whole lot, like everybody else does.","Player"
1012,2019-06-01,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: I'm not sure.  I don't think about what they're thinking","Player"
1013,2019-06-01,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: He's been great.  He's a good rim protector.  He's been guarding everybody in the post for us.  In our first series, he guarded [Nikola] Vucevic.  Then guarding [Joel] Embiid in the second series, he did a great job defensively.  Just another smart player on the floor that's been through the ups and downs of the NBA.  Veteran guy who is just ready for the moment.  Him being able to orchestrate the offense at the top of the key, able to shoot the three, it helps everybody.  He's just playing well on both ends of the floor","Player"
1014,2019-06-01,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: Pretty much other than my first year, I just pretty much started having fun.  When you come in as a rookie, you're trying to stay in the league and you don't know what the league is about or if you're going to stick.  After that, I pretty much been have been trying to enjoy the game.  Obviously, it's a lot more fun when you're getting plays called for you and you're able to live your childhood dream in being able to shoot the ball 20 times a game.  The offense is coming toward you rather than just being out there doing one job.  Because when you first come in as a rookie, unless you're like a top-10 player, you're really not going to touch the floor a whole lot or get the offense run through you.","Player"
1015,2019-06-01,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: I feel like I made some big shots in my career before.  I mean, obviously not like the ones now, but it's been fun.  I can't complain about my career.  I had a great time each step of the way.  I had fun with my whole journey.","Player"
1016,2019-06-01,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: I think any team that has been through the experiences that we have and that has won championships has to earn that confidence.  I think players are naturally pretty confident at this level.  Star players, like we have, they have all got confidence.  But what the real confidence is is when you've been through everything and you've seen everything -- you've won, you've lost, you've experienced every high, every low, then you know what this is about and you can dig into your reserve of experience to remember what's necessary, which is really you just keep going back to the basics.","Coach"
1017,2019-06-01,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: I got fined when I was the GM of Phoenix for making a joke on The Dan Patrick Show.  I think he asked me if we were interested in LeBron when LeBron was a free agent back in whatever it was that he went to Miami.  I said if he's willing to take minimum, we would take him.  Dan laughed.  And I wrote a $10,000 check the next day.  So I learned my lesson.  I don't comment about any other players","Coach"
1018,2019-06-01,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: I think it's a team-wide effort.  You have guys who are willing to screen for them, who recognize those situations, where it doesn't have to be a play call.  You don't have to say, all right, we're running whatever, four-out.  You recognize situations where you can just set a screen for a guy.  We got a lot of smart basketball players, guys who can make passes, who can set screens.","Coach"
1019,2019-06-01,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","And then I've said this many times about Steph: He's very unique in that he can beat you on the ball or off the ball.  Most players are kind of one or the other.  But he's a guy who is equally as dangerous in a ball screen with the ball or coming off a pin-down like Reggie Miller, somebody like that.  That's what makes him so dangerous","Coach"
1020,2019-06-01,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: Yup, it's just seeing the floor.  Again, going back to the number of playmakers that we have been blessed with over the years, that's what a lot of opposing coaches have told me over the last few years: What has made us difficult to guard is not just that we have Steph and Klay shooting or KD; it's guys like Andre and Draymond and Shaun Livingston and Bogut and David Lee a few years ago and DeMarcus now.  We have always been blessed with a lot of passers and playmakers","Coach"
1021,2019-06-01,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: You watch a lot of film and you discuss it as a staff.  You discuss it with the players.  And you try to find the right balance.  So the other night I thought that he played well.  I thought we had some really good moments.  I thought one of the reasons Jonas Jerebko made a couple threes and","Coach"
1022,2019-06-01,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: Yeah, he's fine.  He's fine","Coach"
1023,2019-06-01,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: It's great to have the videotape.  That's where you can really learn.  We had a good film session yesterday.  We'll have another one today.  I think a team like this that pushes the ball relentlessly, it's not enough to just say, hey, guys, transition defense is important.  I think you have to feel it, and we felt it the other night.  They ran the ball right past us several times.  As I said the other night, our transition defense was very poor and that has to improve","Coach"
1024,2019-06-01,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: I think it gives them another passer, another playmaker.  I made the comment yesterday that I feel like our teams are pretty similar.  Siakam reminds me a lot of Draymond the way he pushes the ball, the way he play-makes.  We have had a lot of passing centers - Bogut and DeMarcus among them.  Marc is unique because he can make the three-point shot, but he's a really good secondary playmaker.  So when the ball is swung to him, a really good passer, he can move the ball along and generate offense out of any traps or any type of defensive pressure.  He's a very good player","Coach"
1025,2019-06-01,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: I don't think he's been a three-point shooter for that long","Coach"
1026,2019-06-01,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: Yeah, maybe a couple years.  I remember maybe two seasons ago it seemed like in Memphis he started shooting corner threes and they were running specific play sets for him, where he would stand in the corner and the opposing team's big would automatically go help in the paint and he would shoot a wide-open corner three.  But like so many players these days, he's worked at it.  So now he's shooting the above-the-break three.","Coach"
1027,2019-06-01,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: I thought Jordan did a good job.  One of the reasons we started him was because of his speed, knowing we were coming in with a 10-day break playing on the road against a fast team.  I liked his athleticism.  He did some really nice things.  Every game is going to be different.  Pretty much every game this postseason has been different at the center position, based on what we have needed.  The one constant is Looney, who is going to play his 28, 30 minutes one way or the other.  What we're always trying to do is mix and match and find matchups and fill in those gaps with the right combinations that can help us win.","Coach"
1028,2019-06-01,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: I think with great players like Kawhi or LeBron or Kevin Durant or whoever, it's the old clich√©: You can't just do the same thing over and over again.  But in this case the clich√© is true: You can't give a guy the same look every time.  So you just try to mix it up and keep them off balance the best you can.","Coach"
1029,2019-06-01,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: I think just try to use our experience, the best lessons are learned through experiences.  Being able to get through, being down previously, bouncing back is something we have gone through.  So hopefully we can use that experience to our advantage again","Player"
1030,2019-06-01,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: We have been able to watch them through the other series and realizing they're a team that plays really hard, a team you can definitely have a lot of respect for.  They got some guys that can make plays for them and they were able to do that in Game 1.  So just a few key adjustments and hopefully it turns in our favor","Player"
1031,2019-06-01,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: Well, they just do a good job of just looking for the open play, they hit some singles, drive and kicks, guys looking for the opportunities to try to take advantage of them.  Got some open threes.  Gasol had a few, Danny Green hit a few, Siakam hit a few.  VanVleet has shown what he's capable of.  So just got different guys out there who can play solid winning basketball.  So got to keep an eye on all their guys because everyone's a threat on the court","Player"
1032,2019-06-01,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: I don't know.  I mean, I don't trash talk.  So I mean, even when there is trash talk, I really don't know what's being said.  Just being locked in on the game and it's for some guys, not so much for others.  So I don't get trash-talked much either","Player"
1033,2019-06-01,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: You got a special player and he's shown what he's capable of, being able to do damage from the perimeter, getting to the basket, shooting the ball at a high clip right now.  So we always try to say make the game as hard as possible for everybody on the court.  You're not going to stop him, but you just try to make them expend as much energy as possible while he's on the court","Player"
1034,2019-06-01,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: It's always difficult going against top players.  You got to be locked in mentally, physically, it's just part of the game though.  I mean, you've heard it from the history of sports, you just have injuries, you have pains, you just play through it and just try to help the team win","Player"
1035,2019-06-01,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: Like I say, you just try to make the game hard for him.  The few times we trapped him, he was able to make the right passes out of the traps.  He found Gasol a few times and they're doing certain things to try to counter that.  So we have a few schemes here and there, turn it on, turn it off.  So for us it's just our back-line defense, being able to rotate, especially when you know you have a special player who can draw two.  They're trying to make the other guys pay and we're trying to rotate out the right way and it's kind of a game of chess.","Player"
1036,2019-06-01,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: A little bit of both.  A lot of our missed shots and turnovers led to run-outs for them.  When we watched the film, I think we did a pretty good job in the half court, but our transition defense especially, coming on the road in the Finals, you can't win that way.  It's hard to win with 17 turnovers.  So yeah, we cut those couple things back, that will put us in a better position to win","Player"
1037,2019-06-01,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: His presence is great.  Like I said yesterday, his presence is kind of, you know, becoming more and more evident.  It's becoming more and more normal with where he is in his rehab and being around the team more.  So it obviously means a lot.  When you're talking a guy like Kevin, a talent like that, it comes with a different view.  He sees the game from a different perspective.  So it's always good to get that perspective in what he's seeing and trying to incorporate it in what we're doing","Player"
1038,2019-06-01,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: No, our preparation is going to be the same, no matter if we're down or up.  If you're up, you can't get comfortable.  You still have to prepare the same way, and we're not hitting the panic button, so our preparation is still the same, at the end of the day you got to -- when you don't have home court in a series, you got to come win one game on the road, whenever that is.  And that's still our mindset","Player"
1039,2019-06-01,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: Just continue to try to win.  I know all my personal goals, if we're winning, they all take care of themselves.  So for me it's just focusing on that main task.  When you're winning, you get the accolades.  If you're on a team that wins 20 games, you usually don't get accolades, that's just the way it goes.  So you just continue to try to do what we have been doing, all the rest of that stuff seems to take care of themselves as they have for this club","Player"
1040,2019-06-01,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: I actually think that it may be a little easier if you're not necessarily someone who has played a ton of minutes against someone else.  Because that same picture, that same experience that I may have in playing so many minutes against the Cavs, like Loon [Kevon Looney] might not have that same experience.  He hasn't played as many minutes.  So I think it's more normal for them and you come into a game you got to feel the game out, you kind of see where it's going and then you play.  Like I think it's more normal for someone who hasn't necessarily played a ton of minutes against one opponent than us guys who have","Player"
1041,2019-06-01,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: Make some shots.  That will help.  I also think that we turned the ball over too many times.  We got to make sure our spacing is there, make sure we give the guys an outlet, not necessarily -- I think we played in a crowd a lot.  They have great length, that's one of their strengths.  They swung to the ball.  So we have to be better at not playing in the crowd because that's playing to their strengths","Player"
1042,2019-06-01,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: You got to do all the little things that it takes to win a game, especially on the road.  Those things are no different.  So you just got to bring that edge, bring in, just come in with the mentality, with the focus level that it takes to win the game on the road in the NBA Finals.  We know what that means, we know what it takes, we just got to go out there and do it","Player"
1043,2019-06-01,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: They really didn't have any defensive lapses.  When you get to this point of the season, that's more and more important that you're not having defensive lapses.  You look at the way they guarded, it was pretty standard the entire night.  They were locked into their coverages and they did a good job of it.  It's on us to counter that and use the way they're guarding certain things against them, and we have been pretty successful at doing that.  So I have no doubt in my mind that we will here","Player"
1044,2019-06-01,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: I think those experiences definitely make a difference but at the end of the day no matter how many championships you won, you got to come out and play this one.  Every championship series is different, every season is different.  So it's not the same.  You try to rely on those experiences when you can, but you got to go out and play the game","Player"
1045,2019-06-01,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: No, I don't want to be Kawhi or have Kawhi's emotions.  The way Kawhi goes about his game and his emotions ain't get me to where I am today.  So no, I don't aspire to be Kawhi and the way he emotionally approaches the game of basketball.  That set of emotions hasn't worked for me and my emotions hasn't worked for him.  That's the unique thing about basketball. I think it's also one of the reasons fans can't really relate because you see one guy and it's like, oh, well, he acts this way and another guy acts this way like.  That doesn't make sense to me.  Well, that's kind of the unique thing about the sport that we play","Player"
1046,2019-06-01,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: No.  Never tried it.  I probably never will try it either","Player"
1047,2019-06-01,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: No.  It's not even of interest to me","Player"
1048,2019-06-01,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: Well, I think they have a very good mixture of youth and experience.  They play fast, they really space the floor out very similar to how we play.  They have a lot of length out on the floor, very similar to what we built everything on.  So I think that there are a lot of similarities there.  I think overall they may have a little more experience in the guys that's playing a ton of minutes for them.  I think those guys have more experience today than we had when we first started our run.","Player"
1049,2019-06-01,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: I try to take as much as I can.  Obviously every experience is different, every experience is new.  Every team you play with and play against is different and new.  But I think it helps in the sense that a little bit more comfortable probably than the guys that have never been here.  Either way it's not something that you get used to or comfortable doing.  It's still a big stage and against champions, a team that you really are trying to beat.  So you got to stay locked in and focused","Player"
1050,2019-06-01,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: I think our defense is pretty good.  I think also San Antonio our offense played a great defense for us as well.  The way we moved the ball it allowed us to get good shots, which it allowed us to get back and play good defense.  Obviously with Timmy back there who was great, it's hard to compare anybody to him, but Marc is really good, Kawhi is very good, K-Low, Pascal, all the guys have done a really good job of switching down the line and taking pride and putting effort in the floor, just communicating.","Player"
1051,2019-06-01,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: Their offense is built off that basically.  Our offense at times is, but really when we push the pace is when we get more open looks, we're able to have P at the rim, K-Low, Kawhi attacking them, me on the perimeter, sometimes Marc on the perimeter.  It allow us to get easier, open, uncontested looks.  But a lot of times teams know you're going to shoot, so they're going to closeout hard to you.  You try to make a play for yourself or a teammate at the rim, kicking it and then finding space on the other end, and hopefully they fell asleep, just nonstop moving.","Player"
1052,2019-06-01,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: It takes a lot of energy, nonstop running.  That's why it's key for us to make them run or make them play defense, and make them run on that end of the floor as well, try to tire them out, take their legs from them a little bit.  But if we continue to keep our pace, it will put more pressure on them and hopefully take some energy away offensively","Player"
1053,2019-06-01,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: You got an offense built or based around what you do best is shoot the ball and finding you moving off screens.  He's setting screens for other guys, getting himself open, two or three guys setting screens for him or dribble handoffs to find him and looking for him.  It's tough to guard, regardless of who it is.","Player"
1054,2019-06-01,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: I think we match up with each other pretty well in the sense that we can go small, we can go big, switch down the line.  We have multiple guys that can do different things.  Honestly, I think we -- I shouldn't say it actually but I think there's a lot of things that we see that are similar in each other and that we match up against each other so it's really the team that's going to execute and do it for the longer period of time during the game","Player"
1055,2019-06-01,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: It's never easy, but I guess when you're playing against guys similar to you, it allows you to kind of think and know what their strengths and weaknesses are and try to play them toward that.  But at the same time it's a team that you don't see four times a year, you don't see them that often, you don't have their tendencies.  This is the most we'll ever play them throughout the whole year.  And they do different things, as much as you see it on TV, it seems easy, it's like oh what the hell are they doing, they should do that, they should do this.  As easy as it seems, it's tough even switching down the line and talking and communicating because of how well they move","Player"
1056,2019-06-01,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: I think that's been the key for us all year is our pace in transition.  Obviously Pascal's able to get to the rim a little more, so was K-Low, Kawhi, even though they still went before, it was different when there's no Giannis or Brook Lopez or Joel Embiid.  Not saying that they don't have rim protectors of that stature, it's a little different.  So if we run, we get some easy ones where they're on their heels a little bit and there's not many contested at the rim, and when you put pressure on the rim, then you get some open outside looks.","Player"
1057,2019-06-01,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: Whatever happens on the defensive end, as soon as the possession changes, you run at them.  You run at them and be aggressive and use all the 24 seconds to try to get the best shot possible, without turning the ball over and doing the things that we need to do","Player"
1058,2019-06-01,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: There are many keys.  I don't think there's one key.  But to be able to run, you have to get stops.  And to get stops, you have to communicate.  You have to be physical.  You have to do all the little things that are necessary.  Finishing the possession with rebounds.  I thought in the second half we did a much better job of finishing possessions and running at them","Player"
1059,2019-06-01,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: It depends.  If the rotation happens and they leave somebody else open, my nature is to make the extra pass.  If they stay home, it is my job to knock it down","Player"
1060,2019-06-01,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: I don't analyze them and compare them to the way we are or the way we play. I just don't operate that way.  I see their tendencies and how they get comfortable and in rhythm and try to slow them down and do as much as possible to not allow them to get comfortable","Player"
1061,2019-06-01,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: The three-point line.  It's pretty obvious, but you just can't take one thing away.  If you take the three-point line and you allow them to swing to the basket to get dunks, it's just as bad.  So it's a multiple-effort thing.  You have to be in multiple places, especially when you're a help guy.  You have to be up.  You have to be down.  You're going to be up again.  You're probably going to have to crack back and rebound.  So it's a lot of fun","Player"
1062,2019-06-01,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: Communication is obviously huge in any circumstance in life","Player"
1063,2019-06-01,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: Defensively?  If you look at film, you saw a lot of things that you can do better.  But being physical, it starts with pressuring the ball.  All the fundamental stuff.  You have to do it all the time; you can't relax.  Like I said, when you're a help guy, you do multiple efforts.  You got to communicate.  Simple","Player"
1064,2019-06-01,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: Well, it's everyone's effort.  I think everyone wanted the team to play well.  Coach does a great job of allowing guys to play free offensively.  He's very disciplined defensively with the things that he wants, but after that he's very open-minded and encouraging to guys' reads as long as it's a good basketball read and it's what's best for the team","Player"
1065,2019-06-01,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: The first six minutes and then the next six minutes and then the six minutes after that.  And then it's going to be a long series.  It's going to be a lot of games. It's going to be a lot of possessions.  It's going to be a lot of frustration.  It's how you stay in the moment and continue to play the next possession.  Get one more stop.  Get one more good shot.  Those are the things, and eventually you put enough of those together, you're going to have a pretty good chance of winning.","Player"
1066,2019-06-01,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: Yeah, I think about it, especially as of late where you have those kind of run-ins with parents or kids or coaches who are developing the next generation of talent.  They kind of have some of the same sentiments around what kids are interested in in the game of basketball, and what they see on TV and what they try to mimic and stuff like that.  So it's kind of a cool experience.  I always talk about the work that goes into -- everybody sees the finished product these days on social media whenever you see the glitz and glam and what happens out there on the floor, but hopefully they understand and appreciate the countless hours that go into pretty much anybody on this level that is putting on an NBA jersey and the hard work that goes into it.","Player"
1067,2019-06-01,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: It would have been way more fun being up 1-0.  But it's definitely fun in terms of the challenge of being on this stage and understanding one game doesn't define a series.  It's an opportunity for us tomorrow to come out and get one, be 1-1 going back home, which any road team would love that opportunity.","Player"
1068,2019-06-01,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: Like he always does, he's chiming in when he sees something in the locker room, pointing out some X's and O's type of stuff, but more so when you see him putting time in trying to get healthy, trying to get back out on the floor as soon as possible, that's motivation for sure.","Player"
1069,2019-06-01,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: I know it's tough.  Anybody who goes through an injury like that, you kind of feel alienated because your schedule is a little different.  Most of the time you're on kind of iso with our athletic training staff, putting extra hours in.  Stuff starts to feel monotonous, especially with the big stage of The Finals here and now.","Player"
1070,2019-06-01,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: No.  It helps to see it, for sure.  I would say the majority of guys out there, you may feel a certain way, but it's even more glaring when you can kind of see the flow from offense to defense in transition or the missed rotations or sloppy turnovers, where there's a more simple pass that you could have made and stuff like that. You can actually freeze frame it and take that picture in so that you can adjust for Game 2.","Player"
1071,2019-06-01,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: Not as much as you might think.  I think we obviously appreciate each other's talent and skill, and we motivate each other every time we step on the floor.  If he gets hot, I'm like, I want to do what Klay's doing, and kind vice versa.  So probably the only thing is when people make up those random stats -- Mark Medina knows really well.  This year something like the only teammates to make 200 threes in seven consecutive seasons.  It's like, that's really specific, right?  But we got a nice little cutout of a little billboard kind of vibe or poster that I can put on our wall and I make sure I got Klay one so he knows we're in this together.  That type of vibe.","Player"
1072,2019-06-01,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: It will be something that we'll probably remember way down the line when we're done playing.  But yeah, it's just the privilege to play with somebody who can shoot the ball as well as he can and can do it consistently and is always trying to find ways to get better.  In the moment, that's what you appreciate the most.  And even like Mark Jackson, calling us the greatest backcourt in the history of the game.  When he did in trying to speak it into existence, we're trying to make him a prophet","Player"
1073,2019-06-01,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: Yeah, that's part of the reason why we are here.  Self-confidence is key in terms of anybody being successful with what they're trying to do.  We have all brought that together.  The biggest thing is we understand what we each bring to the table and how different we all are, but how much we all love winning.  And the fact that I can look to my right and my left and see those two guys and a lot of our teammates and know that they believe we can win whatever game, we're going to have that edge.  If I throw him the ball and he's going to shoot it, I know he believes it's going in.  That confidence is contagious no matter what the situation is.","Player"
1074,2019-06-01,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: It's been pretty consistent in terms of how it's called in the regular season and in the playoffs.  How the series have gone, this playoff run and all, it's hard to really compare in years past.  I don't really remember.  I would have to go back and look, but it's been pretty consistent overall, for sure","Player"
1075,2019-06-01,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: He's just a dog.  He's competitive at everything.  He wants to be the best at everything, whether it's playing cards or dominoes or playing basketball, whatever it is.  What he's doing off court in his business.  He just wants to be great and he wants to learn and be around great people.  That's what makes him tick, what makes him who he is.  He's always trying to find that edge, and he's kind of ruthless at the same time.  Whatever it takes to be great, he's going to get it done","Player"
1076,2019-06-01,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: Oh, it's mad fun.  I'm entertained every single day.  The passion that he brings to literally everything is something I strive to have myself.  Besides this media session.  I'm just kidding.","Player"

1095,2019-05-31,"Pascal Siakam","Practice","N/A","PASCAL SIAKAM: I think for me, it's just going back and watching the film and looking at ways I can get better.  Obviously, they're going to make adjustments and I have to be ready for whatever comes at me.  And I think all year that's something that I've always done, kind of adjusting and getting better as the day goes on.  I think that a little playoff experience and knowing games are going to be different -- you're going to have different looks than maybe you did the first game or whatever.  For me, it's just about adjusting","Player"

But it was definitely one of the toughest moments in my life, and not being able to go home for the funeral and all that.","Player"

I know I have so much to learn.  I have to grow.  It allows me to look at my mistakes and evaluate them and try to see how I can do better.  Obviously, you never know.  I mean, you get fouls and it's in your head and a lot of things like that.  You just have to be smarter.

1099,2019-05-31,"Pascal Siakam","Practice","N/A","PASCAL SIAKAM: I think the one thing that I noticed is I was out in transition.  That's always something that I've done all year.  I think that was kind of like the first time during the playoffs where we kind of got out in transition a lot.  I was just running and it just felt good.  But I don't know, I think just taking whatever the defense gives me and whatever is there for me","Player"
1100,2019-05-31,"Pascal Siakam","Practice","N/A","PASCAL SIAKAM: I don't know.  I couldn't really tell you.  But I think something that we did last night that was good is transition.  We were out running and that was good for us.  In terms of similarities, I don't know.","Player"
1101,2019-05-31,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: I think we have tried to do a conscious thought process of not really caring what the score of the series is.  I think we know that the games are really hard.  We know that after a win the team that gets beat gets really determined.  They try to fix things.  They mostly play a lot harder and more physical and all those kind of things.  And for us, we just had a lengthy, lengthy film session.  There was plenty on there that we need to do better if we want to win another game in this series.","Coach"
1102,2019-05-31,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: I think it's really hard to do.  But your stated goal would be to try to treat each game, no matter the outcome, the same from a learning standpoint and get serious and dig into the problems and try to come up with some solutions","Coach"
1103,2019-05-31,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: He's a very instinctual player.  A lot of plays in the game out there, there are so many things going on that are more instinctual probably than they are some unbelievable design.  So, yeah, we always say know your personnel and if there's a problem, try to go fix it.  He's really good at that.  A really good problem solver on the help defenses","Coach"
1104,2019-05-31,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: I don't know if they're rules.  They're ideas.  They're ideas, yeah","Coach"
1105,2019-05-31,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: Not that I hear.  I think you would need to be probably asleep or something if you didn't realize that everybody is pretty excited.  To the extent the excitement is reaching out and all that, I mean, it is the first time.  I think any team that goes through this the first time and has abundance of energy about their team.","Coach"
1106,2019-05-31,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: We did at times.  For the most part, I think we played with good energy and effort.  There are always some breakdowns or things you would like to do a little harder, a little better.  A little bit more ball pressure, a little bit more when there's a mistake somebody covering up that mistake as quick as possible, and then somebody covering up for that guy who just covered up for it.  But again, it starts with your defense has to get set up, and this team plays really fast.  Even when you score sometimes -- you probably remember we scored a bucket and they threw it ahead to Thompson and he went and did a reverse lay-up down there at the other end.  So it's coming at you.","Coach"
1107,2019-05-31,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: I've never seen anything like that before.  That's a pretty big stage for a guy to put that kind of performance on.  Almost with any background.  I think you've alluded to his background; it's been a pretty short run for him.  But I talked about this last night after the game when I was asked about it:  He's been given a God-given ability of having a big engine with lots of energy that enables him to play with a certain speed, athleticism, and enables him to work very hard every single day.  That motor he's been given, he's using that to the best of his ability.  He soaks up things.  He takes it to the court.  He works, works, works.  He takes care of himself.  He's really got a burning desire to be a very, very good player in this league.  I give him all the credit for that for using those abilities to the best that he can","Coach"
1108,2019-05-31,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: Yeah, I think the biggest thing that they have changed, a couple things on each side of the ball.  One is obviously the great three-point shooting attack from very deep, the great ball movement and cutting.  I think when people watch them play, coaches watch them play, at any level they watch them and they say, man, we would love our team to play offense like that, spread the floor, cut like crazy, everybody touches it, make quick decisions and bomb in a lot of threes on top of that.","Coach"
1109,2019-05-31,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: I think let's talk about the summer, first of all.  I think every time I would see him every couple weeks it just seemed like he had another bit of presence about him.  Part of his game was growing, but even just the way he was attacking his workouts or watching him play a scrimmage game or something, he just looked better to me almost every time.  That's him just believing in his work, that his work was going to pay off for him and he would take that to the floor.","Coach"
1110,2019-05-31,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","During the season that's what it becomes.  It becomes: Play a game.  Some of our coaches, man, they get a lot of credit for this.  They watch him play a game, they sit down and watch the film with him, they take it to the practice floor about some adjustments and then it shows up pretty quickly in a game coming up.  That is some great learning by the player and that's some great teaching by Phil Handy and Adrian Griffin and Nate Bjorkgren and Sergio Scariolo.  These guys are putting these guys in position to be successful.","Coach"
1111,2019-05-31,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: I think it was certainly a question going in.  I think there always is a little bit -- it seemed like going to Game 1 at Milwaukee we were really wondering how we were going to handle the emotional high from just two nights earlier, that buzzer beater to win the series.  And I think you talk about how fortunate we are to have a bunch of guys that have played deep -- some guys that have won it all, some guys that have played really deep.  Ibaka, Gasol, Green, Leonard.  And then you're saying, well what are these other guys going to do that haven't been here before?  They did a good job, right?  They played.  They went for it.  They played fearlessly, right?  They attacked.  And that's what they needed to do.","Coach"
1112,2019-05-31,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: It's a team effort and nothing has changed from last night.  I don't know, maybe we have another media session scheduled for five o'clock this evening and I'll say the same thing, which is that transition defense is where it starts, and we were just careless getting back.","Coach"
1113,2019-05-31,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: I remember missing the game-winning shot at the buzzer (laughter).","Coach"
1114,2019-05-31,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: No, it's not my thinking.  It's not our thinking.  The thinking is when he's ready to play, he'll play.  It's not like this is a sore ankle or his knee is sore, whatever, and you can play through it.  This is a tricky one.  If you re-injure the calf, then that's it and then he's done for the series.  So when he's ready to play, he'll play.  That's our approach","Coach"
1115,2019-05-31,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: I don't see that.  When he's ready to play, we're going to play him.  Maybe it will be a minutes issue based on his conditioning for not having played in a month or whatever it is, but we'll just have to wait and see.  Once he's ready to play he'll play, and then Rick (Celebrini) and I will discuss what a plan would be in terms of how many minutes and all that stuff","Coach"
1116,2019-05-31,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: Right","Coach"
1117,2019-05-31,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: He's done well with his rehab the last couple of days.  He's continuing to ramp stuff up.  And I'm just not going to answer any questions about do we miss him against this team or that team or whatever.  Because it's just a sound bite and it doesn't matter.  The only thing that matters is we have to win the game with what we have, and then when he comes back we'll put him out there.  Nothing else matters","Coach"
1118,2019-05-31,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: It was a great, great atmosphere.  The national anthem was one of the coolest things I've ever been a part of.  Hearing the crowd sink along to O Canada, it was beautiful.  And I thought our guys responded well.  We're used to playing on the road, hostile environments, all that.  I don't think we played our ""A"" game; I think that's obvious.  I think we did some good things and there are a lot of areas we need to improve.  But the crowd will never have anything to do with that with this team.  We're going to play our game.","Coach"
1119,2019-05-31,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: Kevin is not going to play Sunday.  Yeah.  I guess we have been sort of holding out hope, but I might as well just say it now.  He's not practicing today.  We'll have a practice tomorrow.  But he's still progressing.  It's near impossible for him to play on Sunday","Coach"
1120,2019-05-31,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: Because our training staff is here and we need him with our training staff, and we also need our training staff for the rest of our players.  Kevin also wanted to be with the guys","Coach"
1121,2019-05-31,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: The experience helps.  Winning multiple championships helps because you have seen it all.  There's also just the knowledge that you've been here before.  You've been down.  We have been up 3-1 and lost a series.  We have been down 3-1 and won a series.  Everything in between.  So nothing is going to catch these guys off guard, and they are very accustomed to the rhythm and tone of a seven-game series and how long it takes, how many twists and turns there are.  And you know that as soon as you lose a game, it will be on the crawl that now we only have a 19.7 percent chance of winning the series.  Then if we win tomorrow we'll have a 42.7 chance of not losing the series.","Coach"
1122,2019-05-31,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: I thought we did a pretty good job in the half court.  There were some plays where we didn't rotate all the way through.  The two Gasol threes early in the game stood out where we just kind of stopped; can't do that.  That's regular-season basketball.  Playoff basketball, you have to make every rotation until the shot clock goes out, until you get the rebound.","Coach"
1123,2019-05-31,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: Andre had an MRI this morning and seems to be doing well.  I haven't heard the results yet, but I talked to him and he said he felt pretty good","Coach"
1124,2019-05-31,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: I'm not sure if it reminds me of any of our series, but they remind me of us in a lot of ways.  Draymond pushes the ball in transition; Siakam pushes the ball in transition.  They have a lot of guys who can make plays with the ball, just like we do.  Sometimes they play two point guards with Lowry and VanVleet, and sometimes we do the same with Steph and Shaun or Steph and Andre or all three of them.","Coach"
1125,2019-05-31,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: I think we scored enough points last night.  Andre didn't have his best game, obviously, shooting the ball.  But Jonas made a couple threes.  Alfonzo made a couple.  As long as we're getting some scoring from our secondary scorers, then we're in good shape.  It doesn't matter if it comes from Andre or","Coach"
1126,2019-05-31,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: Thanks.","Coach"
1127,2019-05-31,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: Yeah, that's cool.  People in the States are rooting against us because we beat all their teams.  So it's all good.  When you're at the top, no one's ever cheering for you to stay there.  People want to see you get to the top and they want to see you fall.  That's just kind of the mind of the most human beings.","Player"
1128,2019-05-31,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: No, we don't need that.  We're trying to win a championship.  We know what it takes to win a championship.  So we don't need to reach for extra motivation.  If winning a championship isn't enough motivation for you, then you got other issues","Player"
1129,2019-05-31,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: I think you hit it right there: It's the people that you bring together.  I think our front office has done a great job of not only finding talent, but finding guys who want to win.  I think so many times there are so many other things that you hit on that come into play.  And I'm not going to sit here and say money doesn't matter or accolades doesn't matter.  Who doesn't want those things?","Player"
1130,2019-05-31,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: Absolutely.  It's a different respect.  I respect guys who are top five, top 10 guys in the league.  For instance, like LeBron, he came in the Chosen One, King James, all these things out of high school, and he actually lived up to it.  That's incredible.  He probably exceeded what everyone even thought that he would be, and yet everybody thought he would be everything.  I think he possibly exceeded that.","Player"
1131,2019-05-31,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: Yeah, you can see him inching closer back to the team.  I think so much has been made of Kevin because of what lies ahead for him -- oh, he's not with the team, he's not around, he's not a part of it.  In December or November or whatever month I was out, I wasn't around the team either.  And at times Steph was missing; he wasn't around the team either.  That's kind of how the cookie crumbles.  You're on your own schedule.  You're rehabbing.  You're doing all these different things to get back.","Player"
1132,2019-05-31,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: I think each series is different.  Like you said, those were awhile ago, so it's a different feel.  You never lose that experience.  You can always look back on it and it's more about how you felt, what was your mindset then.  But it's impossible to be the same because it's completely different teams.  And although some of us may have that experience, others on our team have not had that experience.","Player"
1133,2019-05-31,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: People can ask what they want.  I think at the end of the day, it's on us whether we want to answer it or not.  So, yeah, it really don't bother me.","Player"
1134,2019-05-31,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: They definitely have a lot of speed.  I think we definitely come across some teams with a lot of speed.  But we have seen it now.  You can hear about it all you want.  Our coaching staff has preached about it since we found out we were playing them: transition defense, transition defense.  It's different once you see it and once you feel it.","Player"
1135,2019-05-31,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: I'm not sure what the expectations were, but I thought his minutes were good.  I thought he made great passes.  He got to the free-throw line.  I thought he was solid on the defensive end.  First time essentially playing in, what, a month, month and a half, something like that.","Player"
1136,2019-05-31,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: I think it's a little bit of both.  I think some of the challenges they presented for us last night were on them.  You have to give their defense some credit.  And some of it we can do a lot better in executing.  Some shots we make, we missed.  Some plays we make, we didn't make them last night.  So you have to give them some credit, but I think there are also some adjustments that we can make among ourselves in what we're doing and our execution to be better","Player"
1137,2019-05-31,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: It's been down because I've just been getting to the hole.  If I can get to the hole, that's a better shot for me.  Saying that, I don't think much of it.  If I had a three-point shot and I got a lane, I'm going to take that lane and get to the basket.  That's pretty much what it's been for me.  I think I've been pretty successful at getting to the hoop","Player"
1138,2019-05-31,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: I have to be more aggressive on the defensive side of the ball.  I think aggressiveness starts with me and everybody else will follow that.  If I'm on my heels, everyone else is on their heels.  I think that was kind of the story of last night.","Player"
1139,2019-05-31,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: I think that we're champions.  We understand what it takes.  We know what each of us are capable of and we hold ourselves to a higher standard than most people.  I think people hold us to a higher standard, but we hold ourselves to an even higher standard.  So when we feel we're falling short of that, we're not afraid to say it.  And I think that's important in a championship culture, to be able to self-regulate.  You don't always need the coach to tell you something.  You don't always need teammates to tell you something.  You have to know that within yourself and you present that and you do something about it","Player"
1140,2019-05-31,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: I think that it's a great moment.  It's his first playoffs and he's playing in the NBA Finals.  It's a special moment, especially with everything that he's battled back from.  Like you said, the Achilles a little over a year ago, and then suffering the quad injury, what, six weeks ago or whatever it was.","Player"
1141,2019-05-30,"Klay Thompson","Postgame","Toronto Win","KLAY THOMPSON: I mean, Kawhi didn't have his best game to his standards but other guys stepped up.  Siakam obviously had a game of his playoff life.  Give him credit, running the floor.  So we'll have to get back on defense next game and really limit their transition points, make them beat us in the half court.","Player"
1142,2019-05-30,"Klay Thompson","Postgame","Toronto Win","KLAY THOMPSON: I mean, he's very long and athletic.  He's one of the better finishers in the paint in the game, so I know we'll step up to the challenge on Sunday to limit his opportunities, which a lot of them came in transition because he was sprinting the floor.","Player"
1143,2019-05-30,"Klay Thompson","Postgame","Toronto Win","KLAY THOMPSON: I mean, we caught the three with about seven minutes left or eight, nine minutes left, whatever it was.

And it was there a little bit tonight.","Player"

1146,2019-05-30,"Adam Silver","Pregame","N/A","ADAM SILVER: We have been in constant touch with the Chinese Basketball Association, and I've talked to Yao Ming directly about it.  I am not concerned at this time.  Of course we are not immune from global politics, so it's something we're paying a lot of attention to.  I look though to sports, and this is something Yao and I have discussed, where we can use basketball maybe in the way ping-pong was used in the days of Richard Nixon, that there could be something called basketball diplomacy, and it is an area where our two countries have excellent history of cooperation, where we work closely with the Chinese Basketball Association on player development, referee development.  We have talked a lot to Yao, Mark Tatum and I have about the rules, the Constitution that underlies his league and how to create greater competition.","Player"

[EDITOR'S NOTE: The Chinese National Team competed at the 2007 NBA Summer League.]  I think that's an important sign.","Player"

Obviously it's not something you like to see between partners in the NBA.  I don't think there's a role for the League at the moment, but it's something that we're paying a lot of attention to, and there may be an opportunity at some point for us to help create some sort of reconciliation, but right now it's existing sort of outside of NBA governance.","Player"

I mean, putting aside location for a second, they are probably third or fourth on the list of tenants currently at Staples.  I mean, that's just a function of their lease.  Everybody understands that.  I think from a league standpoint, if you had both teams in the playoffs, plus a successful hockey team there, it becomes very difficult for us for scheduling purposes.","Player"
1150,2019-05-30,"Adam Silver","Pregame","N/A","ADAM SILVER: I think it's much too early to have a real sense of where we are the with Players Association only because we're in the early planning process of investigating whether there really is an opportunity.","Player"
1151,2019-05-30,"Adam Silver","Pregame","N/A","ADAM SILVER: You know, I don't think about hockey, per se.  I mean, I'm a fan.  Gary Bettman worked at the NBA years ago when I first started, and so we're generally supportive of other sports.  And the way we look at sort of NBA or our programming is that we're competing against everything else on every other channel, every other form of entertainment.  So we don't necessarily focus on where hockey stands vis-a-vis the NBA.  So I'm paying attention to the Stanley Cup.","Player"
1152,2019-05-30,"Adam Silver","Pregame","N/A","ADAM SILVER: I'm not concerned about his ability going forward.  I of course am concerned with his present condition.  I mean, I don't know a lot more but obviously it's public knowledge that he has a medical condition.  So our thoughts and prayers are with Dan and his family, and we're just wishing that he has a complete recovery, and I have no reason to believe he won't","Player"
1153,2019-05-30,"Adam Silver","Pregame","N/A","ADAM SILVER: My answer is, you know, and it's the same as it's been for other U.S. cities that have expressed interest, and that is that we are just not in expansion mode at the time.  I mean, we're flattered that some other Canadian cities have expressed interest, as some other U.S. cities have, but again nothing new and I've said this before, that we, meaning the NBA collectively, all our team owners, are very focused on creating the best possible competition among the 30 teams.  And I'm sure inevitably at some point we'll turn back to expansion, but it's not on the agenda at this time","Player"
1154,2019-05-30,"Adam Silver","Pregame","N/A","ADAM SILVER: At the end of the day from a league standpoint you're in essence selling equity in your overall league, and you're selling a portion of the growth opportunity outside of that market.  You're selling the growth opportunity in Africa, and I think what we would be looking at is whether if we're expanding, not necessarily the short-term benefit of an expansion fee, but is it additive over the long-term?  Is that franchise adding something to the footprint of the league that the 30 current teams don't?  So that's in essence would be the analysis","Player"
1155,2019-05-30,"Adam Silver","Pregame","N/A","ADAM SILVER: What I think we can do is refocus our efforts, as we have this year, on appropriate conduct for fans.  And making sure that there's a clear code of conduct that's communicated to fans, that it's consistently enforced in every NBA arena and that we're creating a safe environment, of course for the players and all the other fans as well.  And as I said, we have redoubled our efforts.  We have had lots of conversations directly with the Players Association, the players, because absolutely we want them to feel that they're in a safe environment and we don't want them to be distracted during the game or think that they have to take matters into their own hand.","Player"
1156,2019-05-30,"Adam Silver","Pregame","N/A","ADAM SILVER: Well, to the latter part of your question, I think there's always more we can do, and I think standards in society have changed in terms of what's appropriate for people to say.  As I've said before, I think there is a legitimate expectation that you buy your ticket, you go into an arena, I'm only searching for the right word, call it heckle, that people would say, yes, you're allowed to yell and scream when a guy's on the free-throw line or whatever else.  But then there's something else that we call it hate speech which is clearly impermissible.  And I think the issue is, you know, if we just made a list, we know we wouldn't capture everything, and there's some aspect of you know it when you see it, and there's also some words that otherwise aren't incendiary, it's the way they're said or if they're said in a threatening manner.","Player"

1158,2019-05-30,"Adam Silver","Pregame","N/A","ADAM SILVER: I told them that, that I appreciated the way that they had handled it and that it was not going to be tolerated in the NBA, and that we also appreciated the way they had come together with management and ownership of that team.  I felt their response was spot on","Player"
1159,2019-05-30,"Adam Silver","Pregame","N/A","ADAM SILVER: I'm content with where we are right now.  Our Competition Committee is always looking at issues like that.  You can see why we wanted to have strong disincentives for recidivists.  And I understand when you get into that critical game multi-rounds in, that all of a sudden it's like, oh my God, look at the impact that that technical or flagrant is now having on that player's ability to remain on the floor.","Player"
1160,2019-05-30,"Adam Silver","Pregame","N/A","ADAM SILVER: In terms of my level of confidence, it's high.  We put in place several procedures post that incident in Dallas, and that includes regular direct reporting from the teams, confidential hotlines, analyses in conjunction with the league office on the hiring practices of each team.  So you can never have absolute certainty, but I believe that if there was another situation like that it would have come to our attention.","Player"
1161,2019-05-30,"Adam Silver","Pregame","N/A","ADAM SILVER: No, again as I said, he's given plenty of money to other organizations as well, and it's being done in a sort of a thorough way of vetting each group and considerations.  So not at all, and I think that giving away money should be done in a serious manner and in a deliberate manner, and so not at all.  I think our only understanding with Mark is that there would be a process for doing it and there is, and we have been working directly with him","Player"
1162,2019-05-30,"Adam Silver","Pregame","N/A","ADAM SILVER: As I said before, I mean, everything is a bit context specific.  I think in the case of Drake, as I've said before, I mean we certainly appreciate his superfan status, and I know he's beloved in the community of Toronto.  I think certainly we don't want fans, friend or foe, contacting an NBA coach during a game.  I think that even as Nick Nurse later said, I didn't even realize it was Drake or hardly was aware that I was being touched, and I think those can lead to dangerous situations.  You're in the middle of coaching a game and you're completely focused, you obviously don't want somebody who is not on your team touching you.","Player"
1163,2019-05-30,"Adam Silver","Pregame","N/A","ADAM SILVER: Interesting question, I'm not sure.  I think symbolically having our first Finals outside the United States maybe has a big impact on countries that follow the NBA but don't have teams, whether that be in Asia or whether that be in Latin America.  So I think as we look back in time at the NBA calendar, I mean, this clearly is a marker of sorts that here we are 2019, you know, our Game 1 of the Finals taking place in Toronto, Canada.  That will, I think, be a milestone.  As I said, it's come full circle in terms of basketball being invented by a Canadian.","Player"

1174,2019-05-30,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: Well, being the first game of the series, it seems like you got to have a little bit more of your specific instructions in going through, I mean, a lot of the similar things that the Game 1's of each series have entailed.  I mean, you kind of talk about transition defense and you go through those three or four points that make your transition defense go.  So it's probably a little bit longer and I don't say a lot during the regular season, so I've been talking way too much here in the playoffs, but it will be a little bit longer tonight, yeah","Coach"
1175,2019-05-30,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: Obviously Draymond Green has been playing really fast in transition, right, he's snapping the ball off the rim and he's putting his head down and going a hundred miles an hour, similar to Giannis, and he's really making a lot of plays and really playing -- making them play at a really fast pace.  They like to play fast anyway, right.","Coach"
1176,2019-05-30,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: Yeah, he's not dressing tonight.  He's been made inactive.  It does look like we may have him for Sunday to at least dress and, well, be active and who knows then.  It's a few days away and he'll probably improve between now and then, and we'll see how game ready he will be, but the plan as of now is to dress him on Sunday, activate him","Coach"
1177,2019-05-30,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: Yeah, Cousins is a couple things, right:  He's big around the block, he's a guy they can throw it into down there and possibly force you into some double teams and that's always exposing some other things if you have to double team somebody.  He's also a really passer.  They drop him out there at the top of the key, trailing in the break, and they hit him and guys start cutting and he can find them.  So it presents us a few problems.  We have tried to prepare our guys for those and hopefully come up with some coverages that minimize his effectiveness","Coach"
1178,2019-05-30,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: I'm not too worried about Freddie.  Freddie's got kind of ice water in his veins type of guy.  He's took a mid-major school to the Final Four.  He took a mid-major school to 35-0.  He's kind of playing better as this thing's going on.","Coach"
1179,2019-05-30,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: Yeah, the first thing that Alfonzo does is he rebounds.  He's rebounded his whole life.  They always say, what translates to the NBA?  And one of the things they say is rebounding, and he's rebounded his whole life, and he just has an incredible knack for rebounding the basketball, especially on the offensive end.","Coach"
1180,2019-05-30,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: Well, I would love to get in the bonus as soon as we can after the ball goes up.  I think we're going to need to try to attack the rim, we're going to need to try to get there off the bounce.  I hope we can draw some fouls and get to the line.  And I think what you're alluding to is that will stop some of the nonstop back and forth, because we're stopping to shoot free throws, and let it give us a chance to get our defense set or make subs or change matchups or whatever we can do while there's stoppage in play.","Coach"
1181,2019-05-30,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: I'm not sure I can describe it.  I think that I've said this a lot is if you were teaching your kid, this is how you play sports, you would tell him, don't get too high, don't get too low, compete to win, care about winning, don't let your emotions get the best of you, you know, all those things that he is.  And that's the thought that keeps running through my head is that he is just steady, he's always thinking about the play, the next play and how does it affect how we can win that possession, which will enable us to win the game, and I think it's an unbelievable mindset.  Very strong.  Very strong mindset","Coach"
1182,2019-05-30,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: Yeah, first and foremost, I'm really excited to get in there and compete, right.  We were playing every other day there for about, I don't know, 18 days and it's like you're in a battle, you're on a plane, you're watching tape, the ball's going up again and you're back into battle.  And these four days off kind of get you itching for that again a little bit.  And I think that's been the most enjoyable part for me is to watch our guys embrace the challenges of the games, really compete, make good adjustments, change of play, make great late-game decisions.  And again, just play really tough.  That's been like the thing I've been kind of waiting for is to get out there and compete again a little bit.","Coach"
1183,2019-05-30,"Nick Nurse","Pregame","N/A","NICK NURSE: Well, obviously the city's excited, right, and the fan base and the whole country, really.  And that's neat.  That's a neat feeling.  I think there's some real like heartfelt pride, for real, you know, and that's kind of cool, but all the other places I've been and have been a little bit smaller markets than this, they were pretty excited in Des Moines, Iowa when we were playing in the championship of the D-League Finals.  I know that sounds funny.  In fact, I was trying to tell Kawhi that the other day, and he's like, I'm not listening.  I had to show him some pictures of 14,000 people actually showing up for a D-League Finals game.  And I think all the cities, there were on championship runs or whatever, they get excited.  But this is a big city and a first time, and I think the first time always makes it seem like there's a little more energy.","Coach"
1184,2019-05-30,"Nick Nurse","Postgame","Unknown","NICK NURSE: They were both really good.  Especially obviously Pascal had a big offensive night.  I thought he played with really good composure, right.  He got to his spots and got on balance and was patient, and when he needed to go quick and get around him, he did as well.  He had a couple of really tough ones go in for him as well.","Coach"
1185,2019-05-30,"Nick Nurse","Postgame","Unknown","NICK NURSE: Well, he's a really good defender.  And a lot of that comes from -- I always say a lot of it comes from desire to be a good defender and the want to stay on the court, right.  But I think his ","Coach"
1186,2019-05-30,"Nick Nurse","Postgame","Unknown","NICK NURSE: Well, I think the big thing is you got to continue to play defense all throughout the game.  Even though you're trying really hard sometimes and they will come down and they will make you look silly sometimes.  They will hit, cut, boom layup, and you're just like, man, how did that happen?  That happened fast.","Coach"
1187,2019-05-30,"Nick Nurse","Postgame","Unknown","NICK NURSE: Well, I think that one of the best things about this team is that you don't have to put a burden of 20 to 25 points on him, because he's going to defend, he's going to lead the team, he's going to make those tough plays.  He just instinctually does that game after game after game.","Coach"
1188,2019-05-30,"Nick Nurse","Postgame","Unknown","NICK NURSE: Well, it gave us a couple nice bounces I think.  We had a couple of shots go in that were kind of eye-openers, let's say.  But the fans obviously were great, they were loud, they were excited.  I think they were into it and that's the way it should be, man.  That's what home court is, and our fans deserve a bunch of credit for being a big part of that","Coach"
1189,2019-05-30,"Nick Nurse","Postgame","Unknown","NICK NURSE: Yeah, it's pretty incredible, right, first of all.  But I think it was two years ago when we got bounced out of the playoffs, he literally went in the gym the next day and he was kind of like, ""Listen, I need to learn how to shoot.  I see that in playoff basketball you better be able to shoot to be on the floor.""  So went to work that day on his shooting, and I think it changed some mechanics.  But that's a very small thing, he took it and just absolutely ran with it, two, three times a day, every day, just trying to get that part of his game better, right.  And that just shows again he was extremely hard-working like beyond -- I mean just super, super committed to finding a place in this league and improving his game.","Coach"
1190,2019-05-30,"Nick Nurse","Postgame","Unknown","NICK NURSE: Yeah, we're always going to take, try to take what's there and I agree with you, I said a couple times early in the game, I said, ""Have we shot a two yet?""  I kept asking that and Pascal had shot one, but I think we had taken eight of our first nine shots were threes but they were open.  And I love it because the one thing that we must do in this series that we need to do is go for it, and that just showed our no hesitancy, confidence, and willing to just kind of go for it","Coach"
1191,2019-05-30,"Nick Nurse","Postgame","Unknown","NICK NURSE: Yeah, I mean, I think one thing that's been interesting is as the series change and a new team comes in and all those things that certain guys it fits and certain guys it doesn't, and in the rotation or even in the starting lineup.  And it just, you know, Milwaukee just wasn't his series and it was probably good to get that one over with in his view and kind of get a clean slate.  That's what we said, it's a new series, new team, forget about what's happening.","Coach"

He had been struggling from the three-point line in the last couple series, so he got that to go and I think -- actually I'm wrong on that, he had two threes.  But Gasol we left a couple times early in the game and didn't rotate, we just gave him a couple of dare shots and he knocked them down.","Coach"
1204,2019-05-30,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Toronto Win","STEVE KERR: It doesn't matter one way or the other.  So if we had won, then the story would have been that we were well rested.  So but we lost, so we were rusty.  So it doesn't matter","Coach"
1205,2019-05-30,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Toronto Win","STEVE KERR: I thought DeMarcus did a really nice job, made some great passes, we could run some offense through him.  It's so early in the process for him.  He played eight minutes and I thought his minutes were good, but it's a huge adjustment to play after a six-week, seven-week absence, especially at this level in the NBA Finals against a team that is pretty fast already.","Coach"
1206,2019-05-30,"Steve Kerr","Postgame","Toronto Win","STEVE KERR: Well, I think that the biggest thing coming in is we really didn't feel like we knew this team very well.  Obviously we only play them two times a year, and this year's team is different with Kawhi, and the two meetings that we had with them a lot of guys were missing, including Kawhi in Oakland.  He didn't play.  And then I think Steph missed the game up here.  Other guys were missing.  So it's going to be really good for us to have a game on tape where we can really pick it apart and see what we can do better.","Coach"

Our team's different, Draymond's different, everything changes year to year, your personnel, the style of play, whatever, so Draymond's threes maybe are down, his attempts, but he's hit some big ones.  Hit the biggest shot of the game in Portland in Game 4.  The thing with Draymond is that he's just got guts.  He's not afraid of anything, and so we're perfectly happy with him shooting threes because he's smart and he knows when to shoot them, and when he's feeling it and a great passer, great playmaker.  So we trust him to make the right decision","Coach"
1213,2019-05-30,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: I think the biggest thing is just how different it all feels from the first three rounds of the playoffs.  The practice sessions are different.  You get completely taken out of your routine and players are creatures of habit, and so you get to the most important series of the year, most important games of these players' lives and say all right, we're not going to let you go through your usual routine, we're going to make you shoot it at two hoops with 15 of you, and 500 media members watching, no offense.  It's just different.  Everything about it feels different.  It completely takes you out of your comfort zone.","Coach"
1214,2019-05-30,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: No, we take every game for what it is.  There's going to be different looks, different matchups.  So we'll see what Toronto does.  They have got a lot of possibilities.  They're a lot like us defensively.  They can match up many different ways.  So each game's different and we have to assess it as it goes and try to do the things that give us the best chance to score.","Coach"
1215,2019-05-30,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: Yeah, the takeaway is that life was a lot simpler back then.  All you had to do was if you wanted to avoid it was avoid the morning paper and don't turn on talk radio between three and five o'clock.  That was it.  There were barely any other outlets for this stuff.  So now, you know, we're all addicted to our phones, we all get fed this constant criticism and judgment and our players are, they're fair game for everybody on not just daily basis but an hourly and minutely basis.","Coach"
1216,2019-05-30,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: Not going to say because of you asking me in the Finals","Coach"
1217,2019-05-30,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: Yeah, that should have been my answer, what I learned from the first Finals is just always say I'm not divulging my starters","Coach"
1218,2019-05-30,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: Especially to you","Coach"
1219,2019-05-30,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: Well, we have been through this before, that gives us a little help, because of his first injury when he came back in January, I think it was we saw him transfer from scrimmages to actual games and we saw a big uptick.  We were worried about the scrimmages and then he really started playing in the game.  So he's a gamer.  He's a guy who lights up when the lights go on.","Coach"
1220,2019-05-30,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: Well, that's a huge element.  We hardly know Toronto's team and even if you include the two games this year, players from both sides were out, so you can't glean a whole lot from those two tapes.  So this series, unlike the last few years, will be against an unfamiliar foe.  Same goes for them, obviously we only see them twice a year, Kawhi being brand new to this team, there's very little history, real history between the two teams as constituted.","Coach"
1221,2019-05-30,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: I don't know.  I mean, his numbers are off the chart, so it's probably not a statistical goal, it's just winning the game however we can win the game.  That's what we need to do.  So we'll do our best with Kawhi and as I said, we'll hopefully learn from quarter to quarter, game to game and figure out some things that we can do, but we are well aware that no matter what we do he's probably going to have 30-plus points at the end of a game and make a huge impact.","Coach"
1222,2019-05-30,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: Well, in terms of his experience against us, I think there was only one game, the game that he got injured.  So it's hard to gauge that.  But the guy was Finals MVP in 2014, so he's probably better because of wisdom and experience, but not much else to say.  He's clearly one of the very best players in the league and so we got our hands full.","Coach"
1223,2019-05-30,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","MODERATOR: Thank you, Steve.","Coach"
1224,2019-05-30,"Steve Kerr","Pregame","N/A","STEVE KERR: Thanks.","Coach"
1225,2019-05-30,"Draymond Green","Postgame","Toronto Win","DRAYMOND GREEN: I think he made played an amazing game obviously, but he got out in transition and our transition D was horrible, and I let him get in a rhythm in the first half, first quarter really.","Player"
1226,2019-05-30,"Draymond Green","Postgame","Toronto Win","DRAYMOND GREEN: No.  Different people react differently in different situations, so no, I don't, but like I said, I got to do a better job of taking him out of the game","Player"
1227,2019-05-30,"Draymond Green","Postgame","Toronto Win","DRAYMOND GREEN: Well, you know, I mean, really the only time I ever really played him was last year.  I played him the second time we played them this year, I think I probably played 16 minutes or something like that.  I was just coming back from injury.","Player"
1228,2019-05-30,"Draymond Green","Postgame","Toronto Win","DRAYMOND GREEN: Oh, I think we got to do a better job early on.  Like we gave Siakam a couple wide-open threes.  We gave Gasol wide-open threes and like there was no rotation.  So you give guys those type of shots they get comfortable and it's a different beast.","Player"
1229,2019-05-30,"Draymond Green","Postgame","Toronto Win","DRAYMOND GREEN: I think that it was obviously a different feel.  We have always started The Finals at home, but we are relishing this opportunity.  At the end of the day you got to come on the road and win one.  So that's still the mission, we got to win one game on the road and I like where we are.","Player"
1230,2019-05-30,"Draymond Green","Postgame","Toronto Win","DRAYMOND GREEN: Yeah.  No. 1, we got our conditioning back.  At the start the game it was a bit rough after nine, ten days off, but I think we just got a better feel for them.  Like I said, this is a team we really haven't played.  The first time we played them Steph or I and myself didn't play.  Second time we played them, Kawhi didn't play like.  So this is essentially our first time playing this team.","Player"
1231,2019-05-30,"Draymond Green","Postgame","Toronto Win","DRAYMOND GREEN: I think well, No. 1, we turned the ball over 17 times.  They got 17 points off those turnovers.  One of the keys coming into the game was to stop them in transition.  Turning the ball over that many times, they are going to get out in transition.","Player"
1232,2019-05-30,"Draymond Green","Postgame","Toronto Win","DRAYMOND GREEN: You got a question about basketball?  It wasn't really a scuffle because I didn't hit him and he didn't hit me, and I didn't push him and he didn't push me.  We talked.  We barked a little bit, but I wouldn't necessarily consider that a scuffle, not really what I personally would consider a scuffle.","Player"

1234,2019-05-30,"Marc Gasol","Postgame","Toronto Win","MARC GASOL: He does a great job of attacking those gaps, using his body, attacking the angles that the defense is giving you.  He can go both ways.  I just like when he plays that aggressive","Player"
1235,2019-05-30,"Marc Gasol","Postgame","Toronto Win","MARC GASOL: That's not important.  You play the game of basketball, you know.  Whatever happened in the past happened.  I think having a mindset of going for it and knowing that it's going to be okay, your teammates have your back, your teammates believe in you, that's all that matters and he knows that","Player"
1236,2019-05-30,"Marc Gasol","Postgame","Toronto Win","MARC GASOL: They were blitzing Kawhi on the pick-and-roll and allowing the middle of the floor open or they were switching early on the offense.  We did a good job of moving that ball and finding -- I still think we can do a better job on it, but it was good enough and I still think that we can do a much better job defensively than we did tonight on stretches.","Player"
1237,2019-05-30,"Marc Gasol","Postgame","Toronto Win","MARC GASOL: If you're open, you got to shoot them.  Dare, no dare, like you are open, you shoot them.  And then we go from there.  If they go in, great.  If not you keep taking them with confidence","Player"
1238,2019-05-30,"Marc Gasol","Postgame","Toronto Win","MARC GASOL: No, my brain doesn't function that way.  You're out there you're playing basketball like you did your whole life and it's the most fun.  You lock in, not allow when they make a couple shots, tough shots or mistakes that you make defensively, kind of rattle you a little bit and frustrate you.  You got to stay poised during the whole game.  So your brain can't go anywhere else but every possession","Player"
1239,2019-05-30,"Marc Gasol","Postgame","Toronto Win","MARC GASOL: Well, if you watched the previous series against Portland they did that with Damian Lillard and C.J., so we assumed that there was a chance they were going to blitz Kawhi.  So we were understanding the spacing that we were going to have and what kind of shot was going to be open, what kind of rotations they were going to do.  Now, we got to still improve in some areas and spacing and moving out of that, but overall I thought we did a decent job","Player"
1240,2019-05-30,"Marc Gasol","Postgame","Toronto Win","MARC GASOL: Yeah, and I thought that the guys did a good job of finding me in the post the two or three times that I went down there and it went well.","Player"

1242,2019-05-30,"Stephen Curry","Postgame","Toronto Win","STEPHEN CURRY: Obviously the bad is we're down 0-1 but it's not the end of the world.  New experiences for us all the way through, but we have proven our resiliency and ability to win games that we need to, and kind of answer the bell and learn from nights like tonight.","Player"
1243,2019-05-30,"Stephen Curry","Postgame","Toronto Win","STEPHEN CURRY: Nothing, really.  I mean, it was a great atmosphere out there.  They obviously played well, but our confidence remains the same.  Block out all the noise about how, you know, what these are firsts and this and that and kind of the doubt around our team.  It's just come out and play hard, get Game 2, and take it from there.","Player"
1244,2019-05-30,"Stephen Curry","Postgame","Toronto Win","STEPHEN CURRY: KD's an all-time great player on both ends of the floor, so I could sit here and talk for days about what he adds to our roster.  We obviously have proven that when he's out we have, we can have guys step up and that's going to be the case until he gets back.","Player"
1245,2019-05-30,"Stephen Curry","Postgame","Toronto Win","STEPHEN CURRY: I'm definitely not smiling at him and saying, ""Good job, guys.""  We can do things differently, a little bit better, be more physical on him, be more aware of where they are on the floor.  Obviously Kawhi's the nucleus of what they do.  And like you said, we did a good job on them, but we have to keep doing a good job on him.  Especially early in the first half, we didn't rotate well enough and just make them think a little bit more.  They're really comfortable out there, stepping into open threes, a couple miscommunications where almost like practice shots, and obviously they made them.","Player"
1246,2019-05-30,"Stephen Curry","Postgame","Toronto Win","STEPHEN CURRY: Yeah, I mean, the two games we had in the regular season, there was guys missing both nights and what have you, but I'm sure they're in the same situation, not really expecting or knowing what to expect.  So at the end of the day they outplayed us.  Like there's no other way to kind of say it.  They did what they were supposed to do and took care of home court on the first game.","Player"
1247,2019-05-30,"Stephen Curry","Postgame","Toronto Win","STEPHEN CURRY: I mean, his motor is pretty much nonstop.  So even if you feel like you're in transition, you're running shoulder to shoulder with him.  He has another gear he can get to.  It puts pressure on you in transition.  He showed that pretty much all season, but tonight especially when he puts the ball on the floor, he's pretty composed, knowing what he's trying to do with it, and obviously great at finishing, no matter where it is around the paint.  He knocked down two threes, which was big for him to keep the momentum going.","Player"

You work yourself to be able to perform at the highest level on the highest stage and here we are.  So we have earned it.  We deserve to be here.

1250,2019-05-29,"Fred VanVleet","Practice","N/A","FRED VANVLEET: It doesn't matter.  If you're hurt, you want as many days as you can get, and if you're not, you're ready to lace them up the next day.  We'll play whenever the schedule says we play.  It depends on how you look at it.  If you have rest and you play well, then the rest was good.  And if you don't play well, then the rest was bad.  It's that simple.  Everything is performance based, so we have to go out there and perform at a high level","Player"

For me, it's really easy because I just saw the flip side of it not even a week ago.  It's really easy to manage through all of this stuff that comes with the highs of the game.

1252,2019-05-29,"Fred VanVleet","Practice","N/A","FRED VANVLEET: Just we get a chance to play in front of our fans first, and we have to try to get as many wins as we can.  We'll go out there and try and get a win tomorrow.  At this point, I don't think that it's that big of a deal.  But we obviously have to try to use that to our advantage","Player"
1253,2019-05-29,"Fred VanVleet","Practice","N/A","FRED VANVLEET: I think that we all just have a collective understanding of how hard it is to get here.  Him and Danny had a chance to get here before, and then struggled to get back a little bit.  It's not easy.  You don't want to take it for granted.  Serge went seven, eight years ago and this is his first time back.  Kyle has been in the league 13 years; this is his first time.  So just have to enjoy the moment.  I think that we're all trying to do a good job of just relishing it, not taking anything for granted, staying focused on the task at hand, trying to complete our journey","Player"
1254,2019-05-29,"Fred VanVleet","Practice","N/A","FRED VANVLEET: I think we motivate ourselves.  I think that obviously we love our fans and we love this city.  We love this country.  We love playing in Toronto and in Canada.","Player"
1255,2019-05-29,"Fred VanVleet","Practice","N/A","FRED VANVLEET: I don't know.  Just depends on what type of narratives you want.  I feel like we're a very good team.  We have been one of the top teams in the NBA all year, and here we are with a chance to play against one of the other top teams in the NBA.  Sometimes it's just as simple as that.  So those guys are defending champions.  We know that.  We respect them.  But we feel like we're just as good.  It's time for us to go out there and perform at a high level","Player"
1256,2019-05-29,"Fred VanVleet","Practice","N/A","FRED VANVLEET: Yeah, he was a very, very key part of my career.  Just the simple fact that he played smaller guards.

1258,2019-05-29,"Masai Ujiri","Practice","N/A","MASAI UJIRI: It's surreal but I think when you put the team together and we all dream of a championship, we all think about that and I think the change was hard at the time, but we knew the kind of player we were getting, and if we overcame and we dealt with all the issues that we felt that could come together.  I think we were all positive about this kind of moment and all dreamt about it.","President"
1259,2019-05-29,"Masai Ujiri","Practice","N/A","MASAI UJIRI: To give Dwane Casey credit, he prepared us for this, too.  This is not something that started in one year.  I don't know that a team can just start in one year.  So I think, I want to say that Dwane Casey and DeMar DeRozan are a part of this they are part of our journey and how far this has come.","President"
1260,2019-05-29,"Masai Ujiri","Practice","N/A","MASAI UJIRI: Sometimes when you're dealing with pressure and there's games coming every other day, where you're thinking on the fly, thinking during the games, the adjustments to make.  Being a first-year head coach there's going to be an adjustment period and I think he's done remarkably well, even using some of his past experiences - he talks about the D League, he talks about Europe, he talks about mixing lineups and different players at different times with what we have gone through this year with trades and load management and injuries and all the different things.  And Nick has just been one to never complain, never -- he's always, it's always how does he adjust, how does he use what he has with the players.  And to me that's one thing that has really stood out with him, and he's done a remarkable job","President"
1261,2019-05-29,"Masai Ujiri","Practice","N/A","MASAI UJIRI: Honestly as soon as we made the trade I thought that.  As soon as the guy was in our hands, to get a player like that.  He made it clear that his health was a priority for him.  It was a priority for us, and to see the progress from -- and just his mindset when he came into the building, and into training camp, the work he did in the summer, coming into training camp, and the work he's done all year.","President"
1262,2019-05-29,"Masai Ujiri","Practice","N/A","MASAI UJIRI: I give the credit to Bobby Webster, Dan Tolzman, Teresa (Resch), these guys that work, I think, tirelessly scouting these players and studying these players, evaluating them and trying to see what kind of players fit with us.  Our tone is set by Kyle Lowry and I think that the way he plays and his attitude towards the game and winning.  Because at the end of the day I think sports is all about winning and the mentality of Kyle really translates.  The mentality of Kawhi, the mentality of Danny Green, of Marc Gasol, these guys are, Serge Ibaka, these guys are built a certain way.","President"
1263,2019-05-29,"Masai Ujiri","Practice","N/A","MASAI UJIRI: I think being -- it says a lot that the first NBA Finals outside of America is being played here.  Maybe one day it will be real world champions or something, but this is what we dream of.  Every day you come to work it's -- this is it and it's overwhelming because you think, when I look at all the international players we have on our team, from Marc and even our staff and the people on our staff and the backgrounds, it's really brought us together and I think it says so much because that's how our city is, that's how the country is, that we can all relate to the multicultural or the diversity of Toronto and Canada and that's how our team is.  They talk in different languages on defense, they talk in different languages in the locker room, and it's like that in our organization.  And being international myself and being from Africa, I'm proud of that","President"
1264,2019-05-29,"Masai Ujiri","Practice","N/A","MASAI UJIRI: I don't know that any of those people will argue with me that he's the best two-way player in the NBA and when we talk about basketball, we're talking about playing on both ends.  And I feel that if we put him on both ends of the court, he has the ability to be the best player in the league and that's where it came from","President"
1265,2019-05-29,"Masai Ujiri","Practice","N/A","MASAI UJIRI: There's something about that guy that I just believe in.  It's incredible.  We have been through so much and he's a winner.  There's no other way to put it, he's a winner.  He's been hit upside the head from every different angle and every different angle in the world, whether it's personal, everything, and he survives it.  Like every day he comes, he comes to win.  Doesn't matter what mood he's in, like he comes to win.","President"

We don't want to -- I don't know if it's underdog, we just feel like we have done a -- like we have prepared well to be here.  And you go through that grind, it's very flattering for us as a team, as an organization.  I know our players would love that, that we get that support.  But these guys have prepared, to be honest.  We have been trying to prepare for this moment, to get here and it's been a grind.  We get mocked.  People talk about us in different ways, but for us that's the growth, that's the thing, those are the things that we have to go through.","President"
1267,2019-05-29,"Masai Ujiri","Practice","N/A","MASAI UJIRI: Yeah, we heard all of it.  Again I say, we have to grow to get to this moment.  It's such an incredible city, sports city, whether you're talking about us or the Leafs or the Blue Jays or TFC, it's a great sports city and there's room for everybody.  But it's incredible how diverse it is and we're going to continue to grow this and live this in this city.

That guy has been incredible and I think his progress you've seen.  Even during the year, Pascal I think should have been an All-Star.  He wasn't a All-Star.  At All-Star he elevated.  After All-Star he elevated.  There was a chip on his shoulder during the Playoffs.  Everybody said he's young, new player in the NBA; he elevated even more.","President"
1269,2019-05-29,"Masai Ujiri","Practice","N/A","MASAI UJIRI: I said it from day one, we are going to be us.  I think Kawhi Leonard is a superstar and we're going to treat him like a superstar, but we're also going to do all the natural things that I think will help us get to that level, to convince Kawhi that this is the place for him.","President"
1270,2019-05-29,"Masai Ujiri","Practice","N/A","MASAI UJIRI: Yes, we needed to -- I think we needed to figure out a way where we played sometimes a little smarter sometimes, the way we defended sometimes, the way we adjusted to games sometimes, our toughness sometimes, just going through those games and having those sweeps or those defeats, that teaches you I think.","President"
1271,2019-05-29,"Masai Ujiri","Practice","N/A","MASAI UJIRI: I think there's different moments for different people on the team.  It's hard.  I'm not big on the trade deadline.  I think people know here I like development, I like growth, and we did try a couple years ago.  We made a couple moves at the trade deadline and it didn't work.  So sometimes you take your chances.  Sometimes these are the things that you have to do.","President"
1272,2019-05-29,"Klay Thompson","Practice","N/A","KLAY THOMPSON: Both those two could be in the argument, especially of our time, this generation.  I think they will be forever remembered in this generation as some of the greatest defenders.  Obviously both Defensive Players of the Year.  Can guard multiple positions.  Their versatility is what, to me, stands out the most.  It's not like they're just protecting the rim, but they can guard one through five and do it so effectively.  So that's my thoughts on both of them","Player"
1273,2019-05-29,"Klay Thompson","Practice","N/A","KLAY THOMPSON: I agree.  He's my teammate of seven years, so I will forever have his back.  And fellow champion.  So he's a three-time champion for a reason just because, like I said before, his versatility on the defensive end is amazing","Player"
1274,2019-05-29,"Klay Thompson","Practice","N/A","KLAY THOMPSON: If it's a bad song, I'll skip it.  But if it's one of his hits, I'll play it.  I've been a Drake fan since I was in high school.  He's a great artist.  Do I like him as a Raptor fan?  No.  But I like him as a musician.  He's extremely talented.  But I will definitely skip the song if I don't like it, and if it's one of his soft R & B songs, I'm going to skip it because I'm in kill mode right now, you know?  I'm trying to get these four games.  So I'll skip Hotline Bling and anything along that line","Player"
1275,2019-05-29,"Klay Thompson","Practice","N/A","KLAY THOMPSON: Oh, man, that's a great question.  It's hard to formulate that answer right now because I think we're in the midst of a dynasty run that's still ongoing.  But hopefully when it's all said and done people will just remember us for our talent, for our ability to play as a team, and the consistency of year in and year out being able to reach the NBA Finals and perform at the highest level","Player"
1276,2019-05-29,"Klay Thompson","Practice","N/A","KLAY THOMPSON: Well, they're similar in the aspect that they have a MVP-caliber player in Kawhi Leonard.  And then they have everyone else who know their roles and they do them very well.  Kyle Lowry has been a staple obviously, and one of the greatest ever to put a uniform on for this franchise.  So you got to give Kyle a ton of credit for willing this team here, especially when he's heard all the criticism about his game and his performance in the playoffs.  But for him to come back and make it here is amazing, and just to kind of prove all them wrong.","Player"
1277,2019-05-29,"Pascal Siakam","Practice","N/A"," First of all, two-part question:  Draymond Green called himself the best defender ever recently, and you might have to go up against Draymond quite a bit in this series.  I'm wondering what your thoughts are on his defense.  And secondly your teammate Kawhi Leonard has just as many defensive accolades, what makes Kawhi an elite world-class defender?","Player"
1278,2019-05-29,"Pascal Siakam","Practice","N/A","PASCAL SIAKAM: I'm going to answer the Kawhi question first.  I think what makes him special is just his length.  He definitely understands the game and kind of like knows like kind of what's going to happen, and then his physical features are just amazing and his hands and being able to just deflect passes and get steals, and then he's just a crazy athlete and also just understanding the game.","Player"

For me especially just being that close to guys like Jakob and DeMar and you all those guys, and being here with them it was definitely something that was tough, a tough pill to swallow and just knowing that we kind of shared stories with these guys and we bond something special.","Player"

But I don't know what to tell you guys.  I think you guys are trying to see something and I don't know for me I just see him as Kawhi, like he comes in, gets his work done and then off the court he's just with us like everyone else.  Like literally it's normal, it doesn't even feel like, oh I don't know, like what is he doing, like is it -- you know what I mean?  It's just normal.  Like I don't know what to tell you.  I think he's just normal like","Player"

It's kind of funny how much his love and passion for the game and for the team really affected the opponents.  Having the opposing coaches come out and talk about what he's doing and how he shouldn't be allowed to do all that, you can see that it's probably bothering them a little bit.  But he's staying within the rules, so I don't see a problem with it.  I love what he's doing","Player"

1289,2019-05-29,"Norman Powell","Practice","N/A","NORMAN POWELL: Honestly, I don't know.  I think rest is really important, but also I feel like rhythm and flow to the game is as well.  Not saying that I would want less days; you want to wrap up a series as quickly as possible.  They had 10 days and we had five.  I think five days is enough time to rest and recuperate, get your mind and body right.  Especially for the guys who are playing heavy minutes all series and playoffs long, I think five days is good.  We'll still be able to have our game rhythm and flow","Player"
1290,2019-05-29,"Norman Powell","Practice","N/A","NORMAN POWELL: Just being tied in.  I think our best defense is when all five guys are able to guard everybody.  We're able to switch.  We're able to do a bunch of different coverages.  We know that they like to move it.  They have plays they like to move without the ball.  So just being really tight and locked in in our foundational defense, and being locked into the guys off the ball is the most important thing.  It's just going to be a full five-man job whoever is out there guarding all five of them","Player"
1291,2019-05-29,"Norman Powell","Practice","N/A","NORMAN POWELL: I get a lot of random requests for tickets.  I think our guy Kevin [DiPietro] does a great job of keeping that and not letting that be a distraction for us.  I have a lot of family coming out and he does a great job of reaching out to my mom and getting the ticket requests ahead of time so I don't have to worry about it during the games.  He does that for everybody on the team.  But the most random is probably messages on Instagram","Player"
1292,2019-05-29,"Norman Powell","Practice","N/A","NORMAN POWELL: Just coming out with a lot of energy and really tying into what the game plan is.  They like to get out in transition and they shoot a lot of threes.  I think for us we have to really focus on getting our defense set, limiting them to one shot and being able to take care of the ball and not give them easy looks in transition.  ot turning the ball over, taking care of it, trying to get a shot up on every possession to be able to give ourselves the best chance to get our defense back.","Player"
1293,2019-05-29,"Norman Powell","Practice","N/A","NORMAN POWELL: Exactly.  We played against them before.  They're not a team that we haven't seen or faced.  We know their guys.  We know them pretty well.  Serge played with Kevin Durant.  We played against Steph and them since we have been in the league.  We know what they do.  We know how they play.  We know who they are.","Player"
1294,2019-05-29,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: I think for sure he's been probably a leader since we got here, and again he's a natural kind of leading type personality.  He plays the point guard position.  He plays a tough brand of basketball.  So that's leading by example, the way you play that way.  The possession you're talking about, you could go back and find a few of those.  I think Game 5 or Game 4, I can't remember which one, down in Orlando he got a rebound late in the game in a one-possession game that kind of sealed the win.  It might have been two rebounds again in the same possession in that thing.  And not unlike Kawhi getting a big offensive rebound in Game 6 here against Milwaukee.","Coach"
1295,2019-05-29,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: It remains to be seen, obviously, but I think just looking back at the series we have played, I think there's been a lot of, I wouldn't say -- some of the adjustments we made were done really on the fly.  Some of that communication that you're talking about, that maybe wasn't the exact coverage we were in or coverage we wanted to be in, where somebody would communicate, like you just said, communicate a different deal, a switch or a non-switch or whatever it would be and just make the next play.  I think against this team, I think against most teams in the NBA, you have to play that way, especially this time of year.","Coach"
1296,2019-05-29,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: I would say that both those guys are in the same discussion, right?  I always think that there's always a discussion of some guys and they're right there.  First of all, you've got some physical abilities, you've got some God-given abilities, you've some size, speed, athleticism, quickness.  And then you go to the next part of it, and I always keep saying this: You've got a tremendous desire and pride to stop people and make plays and want to infuse your team with enthusiasm to play defense.","Coach"
1297,2019-05-29,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: Yeah, and a lot of those things.  I think Kawhi again takes a lot of pride in being a two-way player.  That's again where it starts.  You have to want to do it.  Then he has some ","Coach"
1298,2019-05-29,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: First of all, I think my goal early in becoming a head coach so young was to find out if I could do it.  I just wanted to see if I could be a good head coach and then start learning from head coaching.  So all those stops -- I don't know how many years it was, 18, 20 years -- of being a head coach, and in some pretty remote places, was still I think a valuable learning experience for me from just running and managing the team and being up in front of a team and preparing scouting reports and trying to figure out chemistry and lineups and schemes.","Coach"
1299,2019-05-29,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: I do have memories of that game.  I watched the whole game, I think it was yesterday or the day before, on tape.  So I know it pretty well.  It's pretty fresh in my mind","Coach"
1300,2019-05-29,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: I'm just trying to watch like I do like any coach does, just trying to watch coverages and things like that.  Things that can I pick up that stuck out as far as the way they guarded him and who guarded him and all that kind of stuff.  Just trying to gather as much information as you can.","Coach"
1301,2019-05-29,"Nick Nurse","Practice","N/A","NICK NURSE: I think, first of all, I would say they're going to probably do something similar to what we're going to do.  There are a lot of bodies that can guard a lot of different people.  I think you are going to see a lot of different people.  Plus, these guys brought the switching defense to prominence years ago and now everybody is doing it.  So both teams are going to be switching a lot.  Matchups naturally end up in one possession with three different guys guarding a guy because there's screening going on.  So I think both teams probably go in with the mindset of okay, that's our ideal matchup and your chance to play primary defender if you don't want to switch some stuff and keep a certain guy on him that's having good luck.","Coach"

So when I do get my number called, I'm just confident in going out there and doing the things that I have been working on.  I think it's like that for the rest of the guys.  We all have been putting in the work this year behind the scenes, and guys come off the bench ready.  Coach always says, he never knows what's going to happen, who he's going to put in the game and stuff like that, so just be ready.  I think everybody has been pretty solid this whole season","Player"
1303,2019-05-29,"Alfonzo McKinnie","Practice","N/A","ALFONZO McKINNIE: The 905 helped me out a lot.  I salute Jerry Stackhouse, one of my favorite coaches.  He pretty much helped me develop into that wing defender.  In previous seasons, I was playing the big guy.  But when I came to Toronto, they wanted me to be a 3-and-D.  So I had to transition from guarding bigger guys to guarding wings and guarding the smaller guys.  I think Stackhouse, he helped me develop that with my time with the 905","Player"

1305,2019-05-29,"Alfonzo McKinnie","Practice","N/A","ALFONZO McKINNIE: KD is a great player.  When he is around, we can just throw him the ball and tell him to go get a bucket.  So when he's around, we're happy with that.  But when he's not around, I think that other guys have to step up, guys like myself and the other guys coming off the bench.  I think Andre stepped in and has been doing an amazing job filling that void, especially on the defensive end, having to guard all those type of guys.","Player"

I think people really don't know the severity of the injury and how my life could be totally different, I probably wouldn't be here talking to you right now and so it was just a lot.  And to go back to The Finals again and not be able to compete and be out there with my team but also, just to dress, but there was just a lot of emotions of going through something so drastic.

It really shows me all the hard work I put in.

It gives you a clearer understanding of what's going to happen in the game.  And when you know what's going to happen, you know what to expect, you can get yourself ready.

Maybe to fans or people that don't like him, or don't like his music, whatever, I don't know, but it's not annoying to me.  I think it's part of the game.  For him he's having fun with it, right?  And it sounds like he gets the fans into it and the crowd is good for the game.","Player"
1341,2019-05-29,"Shaun Livingston","Practice","N/A","SHAUN LIVINGSTON: It's just going to take our togetherness, again, relying on our past experiences being in these type of situations.  We got great players, great guys, that have been in this situation before, so relying on our leaders and also staying together and then our communication from top down, knowing what we're trying to accomplish and continuing to hit that home throughout these next two games.","Player"
1342,2019-05-29,"Jeremy Lin","Practice","N/A","JEREMY LIN: It's great.  Again, I just try to take it one day at a time because tomorrow isn't guaranteed, and I know that everyone's said that and everyone knows that theoretically, but when you get cut twice, when you get traded multiple times, you have season-ending injuries and all different, and everything in between, like tomorrow isn't guaranteed, it really isn't.  So I've seen that, experienced that, and so I really just try to take it one day at a time.  And every day that I step on the floor, I really try to be grateful for it, even if it's just working out, and like today I got a workout in before practice and just being able to do that and be healthy again, and then come out here.  They said there would be like some media, but this is not some media.  This is insane.","Player"
1343,2019-05-29,"Jeremy Lin","Practice","N/A","JEREMY LIN: The biggest thing with any great player, any superstar is not that you're going to stop them, it's that you're going to make it as hard as you can.  Maybe if you make them a little bit less efficient -- even if they score the same amount or whatever, and their percentage is the same, even if they had to work hard and expend more energy, because that will be, that will pay dividends on the defensive end or late in the game or whatever the case may be.  So to go in against Steph you're not expecting to stop a player like that, you're just trying to make it as difficult as you can, trying to be physical, take away his favorite -- his I guess they're all easy looks for him but his easiest looks, and you're just trying to work against anything that is his number one option, his number two option or what makes him the most comfortable, you just want to try to take that away.  That's really just consistent across the board for all great players.","Player"
1344,2019-05-29,"Jeremy Lin","Practice","N/A","JEREMY LIN: I mean I'm not -- I'm not the other people, so I can't really explain or whatever, but I don't want this to be about that because that was, that experience was exactly what it was supposed to be and I really believe everything happens for a reason and God has a perfect plan.  So I had to grind and scrap and claw, and that's exactly what it had to be and I'm grateful for that, and I'm also glad that I went undrafted, too, and had to go to Summer League.  I just felt like it put a different chip on my shoulder, and I think that was just part of, that's part of the story, that's part of the experience","Player"
1345,2019-05-29,"Jeremy Lin","Practice","N/A","JEREMY LIN: This is probably my most memorable story of Steph:  I don't know what our record was, but we weren't great that year that I was there and, after 81 games he had gone through ankle injury after ankle injury after ankle injury, and we were literally going into game 82, the last game and he rolled his ankle the game before, and everyone was like, ""Don't play, we're not playing for anything.  You're risking it.  You already injured your ankle a bunch of times.""  And so for me I was, you know, excited in terms of getting an opportunity to play, because they were you know they had called me up from back then the D-League and so I was getting excited to play.","Player"
1346,2019-05-29,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: Just anxiousness, wanting to get to the game and play.  When I was young my first Finals, 20, probably second year in the league, and not knowing really what to expect.  But after that, going into my second one, you pretty much know what to expect, and we were playing the same team.  It's just the same basketball game.  It's five-on-five.  It's still two hoops.  So you just go out there and play hard and live with the results","Player"
1347,2019-05-29,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: Yeah, now you get to see how it is every day for 41 games.  Before you would come, you know that their crowd does come out when you're playing here on the road.","Player"
1348,2019-05-29,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: I think he should feel that way about himself.  You have to come into these games confident and know what can you do on the floor.  I don't know how to just compare myself against him.  I don't really do that.  Just for myself and what I bring to the game, I guess we both can switch one through four, one through five on the floor.  Both bring energy to the game.  We want to play defense.  We want to stop the player in front of us.  And that's pretty much it.  He's leading them on that end of the floor as well","Player"
1349,2019-05-29,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: The thing that helps me is we might get a steal, help my team get an easy look in transition or being able to play defense, we limit them to one shot, probably get a rebound, come down on offense again with some pace, I guess that helps.  I mean, but it's two different sides of basketball.  It's not like just because I get a stop, I'm going to make a shot or do a good move","Player"
1350,2019-05-29,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: Not really.  I never really thought of it that way, but maybe.  There are good offensive players that are not good defensive players and there are the other way around -- good defense, not good offense.  So I think it just really comes to being smart and just being in those situations before and just knowing what's going to happen, going through years of playing and seeing defensive schemes or offensive schemes and watching film and seeing how they guarded other guys or me in the past","Player"
1351,2019-05-29,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: No, I'm not playing the game for that reason.  I'm playing to have fun and try to be the best player I can be.  I'm happy with myself and what I have done in my career and I'm just going to keep on from there.  It's not about me being famous or want to have more fame than those guys.  It's about me playing basketball and having fun on the floor","Player"
1352,2019-05-29,"Kawhi Leonard","Practice","N/A","KAWHI LEONARD: Yeah, going to the Eastern Finals on this team, and as each series goes, you get more media or asked more questions about what's going on.  But I think once this is over, it's still between the lines.  You're playing five-on-five.  We're still playing basketball.  We have a scheme.  Just focus on that and don't focus on the outside attention.  We know what we need to do here inside this locker room every day, so don't pay attention to people who are not in your locker room.","Player"
1353,2019-05-29,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: No, Kevin is, I think we already announced he's not playing in Game 1.  His next step is individual court work, so that will be the next priority over the next couple of days.  Hopefully he can wrap that up, and then he's going to have to practice.  We have to see him in practice before he can play a game, and he hasn't practiced yet","Coach"
1354,2019-05-29,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: DeMarcus has done an amazing job coming back from the injury, which we felt at the time was season-ending.  He's done an incredible job of rebounding, rehabbing.  Now here he is, he's scrimmaged a couple times this week.  He's pain-free.  So it's really more a matter of rhythm and timing and conditioning, all those things.","Coach"
1355,2019-05-29,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: It hasn't been decided yet","Coach"
1356,2019-05-29,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: Yeah, it's very different.  And it's exciting.  Toronto has always been a favorite stop, a favorite city of mine and I think a lot of people in the NBA.  It's a great crowd.  I think going way back before I was even coach of the Warriors, when I was doing TV the two arenas that I felt were just the most electric were Oracle and here.  And you could tell that there was just kind of this organic love and energy and passion for basketball in both places, because neither team was that good, and yet the arenas were filled and there was so much excitement.  And I think that the sense now that we have as a team is we can understand, we can feel how important this is to the whole country.","Coach"
1357,2019-05-29,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: Well that was, I believe, 2017.  He was having a great game.  The Spurs were kicking our butts.  They were up 23 points.  They were having their way with us.  But in terms of how Kawhi has grown, I don't know, he was Finals MVP in 2014.  So five years later he's probably a little bit older and wiser.  He's definitely older.  I think he's wiser.  I think he's seen more.  As you get older in your career, especially as a great player like he is, you see more and more coverages.  You see how different people play you.  So he's probably a little more rounded as a player, more aware of how teams are trying to play him.","Coach"
1358,2019-05-29,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: He's been great on and off the floor.  His leadership has been great.  He lost some weight and got himself in much better condition over the last couple months.  You can just see it.  Watching the two Toronto games on tape that we played, I think one of them he missed, if I'm not mistaken.  Maybe he played both. [Green missed the first game against the Raptors.]","Coach"
1359,2019-05-29,"Steve Kerr","Practice","N/A","STEVE KERR: Well, he's tough.  That's the thing that jumps out at you when you watch Kyle is he's a leader and he's tough, physically and mentally.  I think he's in a perfect role where he can lead without having to be the best player.  They have the continuity now of having this team around him, and then you add Kawhi, the superstar.  Now I think Kyle can be in the perfect role for himself and for his team, which is point guard, leader.  He can step up and have big games when he has to, but he's not relied on for that scoring night in and night out.","Coach"
1360,2019-05-29,"Jonas Jerebko","Practice","N/A","JONAS JEREBKO: It's been a circus all year.  So it's not really different.  I'm really just looking forward to Game 1 and take it one game at a time.  This just comes with it.  I've done media all year.  There might be a few more cameras and a few more people, but that's it","Player"
1361,2019-05-29,"Jonas Jerebko","Practice","N/A","JONAS JEREBKO: They have had a great year.  Obviously they're in The Finals, coming out of the East.  They have got a great team, great coach.  So it's going to be tough, but we're tough to beat too.","Player"
1362,2019-05-29,"Jonas Jerebko","Practice","N/A","JONAS JEREBKO: Yeah, I feel like the last few years everybody is trying to play like Golden State and mirror them.  That is ball movement.  Just like I said, they played great all year.  They're a tough team.  They move the ball well.  They're great in transition.  Have a good defense.  Just looking forward to getting out there","Player"
1363,2019-05-29,"Jonas Jerebko","Practice","N/A","JONAS JEREBKO: NBA Finals, ever since I was a kid it's been the goal of my life.  So to be here now -- we have been off for 10 days since the last game, so I just want it to be tomorrow already.  I want to get going.  It's one game at a time, and all I'm looking forward to is tomorrow","Player"
1364,2019-05-29,"Jonas Jerebko","Practice","N/A","JONAS JEREBKO: Yeah, it's awesome to be here in Canada.  I don't know the percentage of people in Canada who watched that last game, but I bet you it will be more tomorrow.  And it's just awesome.  Basketball is getting bigger all over the world, and it's the best sport in the world.  We are just trying to promote it as much as we can in the NBA.  A lot of international players on the floor and on the other team in Toronto, and then myself trying to promote it back in Europe.","Player"
1365,2019-05-29,"Jonas Jerebko","Practice","N/A","JONAS JEREBKO: Yeah, they want to talk to me now when it's The Finals, but I'm always trying to promote basketball back home in Sweden.  It's also growing.  Maybe at a slower pace than other countries, but I feel the support at home.  It's The Finals now so now they're going to come around, hopefully","Player"
1366,2019-05-29,"Jonas Jerebko","Practice","N/A","JONAS JEREBKO: This is what you play for.  This is why you put in all the hours in the offseason.  This is why you're late in the gym or get up early in the morning to go for a run or whatever it might be.  These are the moments you are trying to get to.  I'm really just trying to take it one game at a time, looking forward to tomorrow.  But, yeah, it's been a lifelong dream to be in The Finals.","Player"
1367,2019-05-29,"Jonas Jerebko","Practice","N/A","JONAS JEREBKO: I feel like we play well on the road.  We played well on the road all year.  I'm not really worried about starting at home or on the road.  Our mindset is going to be the same.  We're going to try to execute our game plan and just go out there and play our game.","Player"
1368,2019-05-29,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: We all have expectations of ourselves.  We raise the bar just as high as anyone else does for us.  For us, it's just getting through the regular season, getting through the noise.  There's more and more noise every year, especially with our team and how many eyeballs we draw.  Just keeping a level head and understanding the roller coaster of the season.  Just getting through each phase.  It sounds easy, but there's a lot of mental preparation that goes into it","Player"
1369,2019-05-29,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: Honestly, just pieces fell into the right place at the right time.  It's a true blessing just how things kind of came into place.  You really can't plan for the way things came about for us.  It was just the right time and the right guys at the right time.  The guys being brought up in the right environment for them to succeed and then other guys being in the right place at the right time.  Everything just seemed like it the stars were aligned","Player"
1370,2019-05-29,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: Game 1 is kind of like a feel-out game.  Neither team played at full strength against each other this year and it's a different look for each team, so it's kind of going to be a lot of wild punches thrown and guys trying to figure out where to find their rhythm, their groove.  There's going to be a lot of energy in this building, so just understanding the patience it's going to take.  Just getting through all of that and not letting the moment take too much control of you and just trying to settle in as best as possible","Player"
1371,2019-05-29,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: Well, we always say that we respect the opponent.  Understanding what you're going up against.  There are two teams here and both of them deserve it.  They did the right things, and it's more than just talent -- having the effort, chemistry, camaraderie.  That team, we really respect them.  They put their work in and they're coming out without fear.  We know the preparation that they put in to try to come in and prove everybody wrong.  Everybody is counting them out as if we just win and just go out and the game's over.  But teams really believe in themselves and we have to be ready for the challenge","Player"
1372,2019-05-29,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: I think we try to have a good balance.  Trying to use the adrenaline to your advantage.  The first one, the first two, you're over-excited and you have a little bit of nerves.  But then the more and more you go, you can't get too comfortable.  You have to try to find the right balance to go into Game 1","Player"
1373,2019-05-29,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: He's kind of got a different game than anybody.  He's very unique.  His strength, with his quickness, being able to explode to the basket, but also being a threat from the perimeter.  So he's pretty much got it all.  I guess trying to throw him off balance.  Belichick always says, ""Try to make guys play with their left hand.""  That sounds easier than it actually is.  With him, just making him make tough plays, put him in tough situations.  That's easier said than done too.","Player"
1374,2019-05-29,"Andre Iguodala","Practice","N/A","ANDRE IGUODALA: I don't know if I all the way agree with that.  It's starting to kind of trend against us, where guys are kind of afraid to come because of the expectations and the media challenge of coming here and having to deal with so much.  But we have done a good job of setting the right culture, and the guys who come here really enjoy it.  Once they get here, they realize that there's nothing else like this.  We're going to continue to try to live by our values, keep the culture where we've placed it and try to maintain the success we've had on the court.","Player"
1375,2019-05-29,"Serge Ibaka","Practice","N/A","SERGE IBAKA: We have to just go out there and play basketball like we have been playing basketball games in the playoffs and I think if we just focus on what we can do, focus on us, I think we'll be fine","Player"
1376,2019-05-29,"Serge Ibaka","Practice","N/A","SERGE IBAKA: Going back to The Finals is, it showed me how a lot of those years I've been putting in a lot of work, and after seven years, and it just made me be so thankful, man, it's not easy.  Even them, you see them going back to The Finals every year and they look like it's easy, like people say it's too easy for them.  It's not that easy.  You have to give them credit.  But being in this position now I know how hard it is.  So I'm just thankful.  I'm so thankful","Player"
1377,2019-05-29,"Serge Ibaka","Practice","N/A","SERGE IBAKA: I think that's so good to see Kyle be here for so long, I don't know, seven years and Marc has been in the league now for 11 years now, for them the first time to go to the NBA Finals.  I think that's the beauty of all the hard work you put in during the summer and during the season and it's the motivation","Player"
1378,2019-05-29,"Serge Ibaka","Practice","N/A","SERGE IBAKA: Yes, yes, of course, I'm going to do it, I'm going to do it.  That's the vet's job, right.  That's why when you're on a good team you got some vets it's for all those things too.  It's not only playing on the court but talking with the guys, talking to your teammates, that's the job, that's their job, and I'm going to do it, for sure","Player"
1379,2019-05-29,"Serge Ibaka","Practice","N/A","SERGE IBAKA: What happened to me this season is exactly what I was looking for.  After last year, I mean everything happening in the playoffs, the way everything ended up, it was not fun.  So, and I told myself after last year that I had to be a better player, a better teammate and I had to help my team and my teammates to be better.  And we did it this year now here we are in the NBA Finals","Player"
1380,2019-05-29,"Serge Ibaka","Practice","N/A","SERGE IBAKA: A little bit.  When things start happening at the moment you start thinking a lot, you know, a little bit.  But after a couple days I said, you know what, only thing I can control now is myself, to go back in the gym and put in the work and then focus on the next season","Player"
1381,2019-05-29,"Serge Ibaka","Practice","N/A","SERGE IBAKA: I think when you respect your opponent, that makes you even more dangerous, because you, the fact you respect them, that you know you have to go out and play.  So because we know we have to go out there to play because they're so good.  And they show like they're one of the best offensive team in the last 10 years, so that's going to push us, motivate us to go out there, we have to be focused and play","Player"
1382,2019-05-29,"Serge Ibaka","Practice","N/A","SERGE IBAKA: Mentally prepared, we focus on the moment right now and we just we try to learn what to take from the last round and then we're just now we're focusing on now and then it's different teams, and the NBA playoff, different team, different style and we know we have to change a couple things to go forward, but our focus now is to go out there and play.","Player"
1383,2019-05-29,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: I think as a competitor, if you're trying to do something meaningful, if you don't have the mindset that you're the best ever, you failed already.  So if you don't have the mindset that you are the best reporter ever, then you already failed.","Player"
1384,2019-05-29,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: I think he got that nickname because he has some of the largest hands we all have seen.  However, his defense is great","Player"

1386,2019-05-29,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: A huge challenge.  When you talk about DeMarcus, he's someone who's been great in this league for years now.  He's probably played basketball what, 16 out of the last 19 months, so that right there alone is a challenge in itself.  Then you start to talk playoff experience, where you and I both know the intensity level is completely different than a regular-season game, and he doesn't have much playoff experience.  And then you get dropped in the NBA Finals.  It's kind of like some kid who grew up in the suburbs going to private school and then one day you just got dropped in the hood and was told to survive.  You got to figure that out.  It's very similar to that.","Player"
1387,2019-05-29,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: I got mad respect for Kyle.  A friend, first off.  We won a gold medal together.  In college, a guy who got it out of the mud.  He wasn't always an All-Star.  He wasn't always a starter.  But he got it out of the mud and he's where he's at today.  He's faced a lot of doubt.  He's been criticized a ton, this year and previous years before, but yet he's still standing and he's here in this moment and it's well deserved","Player"
1388,2019-05-29,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: That title means a lot to me.  But with that title comes great responsibility because when you are an emotional leader, your team feeds off that.  And if you don't bring that, your team usually lacks in that area.  So as it is, Steph has to score, Klay has to score -- that's their job, that's the reality of it.  I have to bring that emotion to the table.  That's my job.  That's the reality of it.","Player"
1389,2019-05-29,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: I wouldn't necessarily say he's not dominant because he just dominates the game.  So I think the challenge with Kawhi is it doesn't look the same.  Like when Steph dominates a game, Kevin dominates a game, Damian Lillard dominates a game, LeBron dominates a game, it does not look the same as when Kawhi is dominating a game.  So it can fool you to just say, we can just guard him this way or we can do this or we don't have to put too much focus into him.  It doesn't look the same; it's not as pretty.  But, boy, is it effective.","Player"
1390,2019-05-29,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: Well, I always think anything we do will be good enough.  That's the confidence I have in our group.  In saying that, I don't think we'll necessarily purposely say, oh, our defense will be okay in the first half but in the second half we're going to turn it on.  I do think we have the ability to say, okay, we weren't that good and we need to focus more here, let's lock in this half on the defensive side of the basketball.  I do think we have that ability.  But you don't go into a series and you don't go into a game with that mindset.  You want to put 48 minutes of great basketball out there on both ends of the floor.  That will always be our mindset.  It's kind of playing out the way it's played, but that's never the goal","Player"
1391,2019-05-29,"Draymond Green","Practice","N/A","DRAYMOND GREEN: I don't know what that word means, ""peaking.""  I hope not.  No, I hope I continue to play better and better and show signs of peaking, but I hope it's not really me peaking.  I hope I'm still getting better.  So yeah, I don't believe in peaking.  That's funny.","Player"

1393,2019-05-29,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: It's important to get every game.  Especially against a team like that, you can't let games slip away or home court slip away.  Because they're very good in their home building.  So we want to try our best to protect home court, get every game possible.","Player"
1394,2019-05-29,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: You got to.  It's what it's all about.  Obviously, you want them to be healthy because you want to play against a 100 percent team, a championship team.

1395,2019-05-29,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: For sure.  You can look at it either way.  You can say that it helped them a ton to get healthy or you can say that they might be rusty for sitting off for that many days.  Probably helped us quite a bit to have five days off.  Five days, we might be rusty too.  But regardless, you have to go out and play a Game 1.  It's kind of a feeler game, but at the same time you want to win that game and figure out what adjustments you might want to make or need to make, according to how that team is guarding you or what approach they're taking offensively and defensively","Player"
1396,2019-05-29,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: Yeah, it's something definitely I'm looking into.  Obviously just learning some stuff, building a r√©sum√©.  Hopefully I have some more good years left in me.  I would like to keep playing as long as possible.  Everybody wants to be Vince Carter, but they can't.  Not a lot of guys get a chance to choose when they can retire.  It's very rare you can choose when you retire.  A lot of guys don't have a choice.  But hopefully I get the opportunity to choose when I'm done.  But when I'm done, it's definitely something I'm looking into doing","Player"
1397,2019-05-29,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: For sure.  I went to Sportscaster U at Syracuse a couple years ago.  Learned a lot.  Some good hours, long hours.  It wasn't easy, and after that point I look at TV very differently.  You understand how hard it is.  Everybody thinks media is easy to do, but it's not an easy job.  I found out how tough it is to be able to talk as fast or have that voice.  You see the level of difficulty in the things they do","Player"
1398,2019-05-29,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: Just all year I tried to prepare them for doing things the right way, being professional.  They know that, though.  It's just the little things.  That's kind of what's going to separate a good part of the game - setting good screens, cutting hard, getting rebounds, chasing down loose balls, getting the 50/50 balls, the effort plays.","Player"
1399,2019-05-29,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: Yeah I think we have.  Offensively, we're playing great.  And hopefully we get OG back, which will be nice.  It will only make us a deeper team.  I think we have the personnel, the bodies, to be able to defend the way we want to and also get out and run offensively","Player"
1400,2019-05-29,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: No, he's definitely the most scrappy guy I've ever seen doing the little things, things that don't show up in the stat sheet but they're in the discussion.  He does take the charges.  He goes after loose balls.  He boxes out.  Just every little thing possible.  He's helped our team a ton.  That's helped us get over a lot or win a series or beat some opponents in certain games","Player"
1401,2019-05-29,"Danny Green","Practice","N/A","DANNY GREEN: Yeah, him getting the ball, not giving us a turnover, giving us an extra possession.  Sacrificing his body for us throughout the playoffs.  He's got more ailments, I'm sure, but that's his game and he knows it.","Player"
1402,2019-05-29,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: Every regular season game was a sellout and that tells you something.  Great city, obviously, very international, you got to deal with the cold, that's pretty obvious, but other than that it's a city that's very supportive of its team.  I had Vince [Carter] on my team and Vince shared a lot of stories about his time here with the Raptors.  Always talked so highly about Toronto","Player"
1403,2019-05-29,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: I don't watch or read media, so I don't know the stories, so I don't know","Player"
1404,2019-05-29,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: I don't know.  I don't know, but it doesn't affect me","Player"
1405,2019-05-29,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: Every possession from the jump ball, competing, communicating, solving issues as we face them, do not overreact to whatever.  They're going to make shots, they're a really good team, but protect the paint as well the three-point line, multiple other things.  It's all the same things that we have been doing but the farther along you go it's harder","Player"
1406,2019-05-29,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: Not much. Not much. When my family got here, we go to parks, we walk around, we like walking, obviously.  But the cold kind of prevented us early on from doing that, but now the weather changed quite nicely and we go outside, we go to parks. It's all about the kids","Player"
1407,2019-05-29,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: A change in the routine.  He's so talented.  He can shoot it, he's a great passer, great size.  I'm sure he's going to be very excited to play.  Whenever that happens, we'll deal with it.  If it's Game 1, Game 1.  If it's Game 2, Game 2.  We're going to be ready to play the Warriors","Player"
1408,2019-05-29,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: Like if you don't move with them, you cannot overreact, you cannot just hug them.  You have to cover a lot of ground, you got to do a lot of talking, a lot of running.  At the same time you have to play the paint.  If they get layups and dunks, it's going to be a hard series","Player"
1409,2019-05-29,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: Yeah, you can't overreact, you can't allow things to affect you as a team negatively.  I thought that we showed a lot of mental toughness against Milwaukee","Player"
1410,2019-05-29,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: I'm not in that mode to analyze what it means to me.  To me it's more like, okay, we have a job to do, a challenge that we're facing right now, and I'm going to enjoy the challenge without a question.  I'm preparing for it.  All the things that you need to do to get ready for Game 1, and then after Game 1 it's a lot more games coming up, so you can't just hang your head and start thinking like whatever's happening outside.  Like just dial in and do your job","Player"
1411,2019-05-29,"Marc Gasol","Practice","N/A","MARC GASOL: You don't prepare for games not to win, you prepare for games to beat them.  At least obviously we have, we're a very confident team, we have a lot of experience, maybe not as a team but as men we do, and I think that everyone prepares and thinks that way, how can you hurt them, how can you try to defend them, and whoever, obviously, that's more of that that's going to win.","Player"
1412,2019-05-29,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: Probably last four years, honestly, they have been knocking on the door.  You always keep up with what's going on in the other conference through every playoff run, and obviously this year's the year they got over the hump.  So realistically speaking, it was 10 days ago or what, five days ago when they won Game 6.  You kind of lock in on what that experience is going to be like 1) starting on the road in The Finals, 2) playing against a different team other than Cleveland, because Cleveland and The Finals are pretty synonymous for us with our experience.  But I would say just this entire year has been kind of wild for us, chasing the same goal but doing it with a lot of noise around us.  And to be able to start here in Toronto against a different opponent in our fifth straight Finals creates a great edge for us.  I like the energy that we're coming in with for Game 1","Player"
1413,2019-05-29,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: Honestly, that doesn't really come into play for us.  We have been here before.  We understand the hoopla and the pandemonium around The Finals and how different things are when it comes to just the schedule and the vibe.  So we have seen a lot and we'll be ready for it.  Have to get settled in early.  We know the crowd is going to be crazy.  For us, it's a great opportunity to go out and just give 110 percent and figure it out","Player"
1414,2019-05-29,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: It's special.  I talk about it every year, my dad having played here for three years.  This is where he retired.  Back in '02, I lived here for a couple years, went to school out here.  My wife grew up in Markham, right down the street.  So a lot of family history, and that side of the family still lives here.  I look forward to coming back here every regular season, and now to be in the NBA Finals it's something I've even been looking forward to if they ever made it.  So it's here and I'm going to enjoy it","Player"
1415,2019-05-29,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: He's tough, obviously.  He's been playing amazing this whole playoff run and really all season.  He's always at his own pace, and never seems to get rushed or be in a hurry.  He's obviously physically gifted and strong.  He can get to his spots, but he's become a really good shooter.  Off the dribble getting to a spot, rising up.  And his counters are pretty solid, too.  You take one thing away from him, he can shift directions, try to get a shoulder by you, get into the paint.  He uses entire floor really well.","Player"
1416,2019-05-29,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: I vaguely remember that.  You say ankle rolls, I have to go through the whole Rolodex of all 50 different times.  So it's hard to pick out one.  But I do remember him when we played with him in the Bay.  When he was there, my impressions of him are just how hard he worked and on a daily basis in practice, challenging me, challenging other guards, in terms of trying to make us better and establish himself as a NBA player.","Player"
1417,2019-05-29,"Stephen Curry","Practice","N/A","STEPHEN CURRY: Just keep doing what we have been doing.  Doing it by committee.  We have had some amazing contributions from everybody on the bench that's come in and produced for us on both ends of the floor.  So we're going to have to play smart.  Myself, stay out of foul trouble.  Draymond, continue to do what he's doing in terms of dominating both sides of the floor.  Just play with confidence and play fast, play loose and play disciplined.  We know what we're capable of.  And when he does come back, we'll be able to transition and hopefully elevate our game even more.  So great opportunity for us no matter who is playing","Player"
1418,2019-05-29,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DeMARCUS COUSINS: I feel good.  It's healed for the most part.  I'm still working things into shape, building the muscle endurance to play at a high level, but everything's coming along well for me","Player"
1419,2019-05-29,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DeMARCUS COUSINS: That's the thing, it's never really up to me. We'll put our heads together and come up with the best plan moving forward","Player"
1420,2019-05-29,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DeMARCUS COUSINS: Well, that's hard to determine with most athletes.  We're stubborn, we're bullheaded, we feel like we can fight through anything, and that's not always the best case for the individual.  So obviously we'll come together and figure out the best plan for me","Player"
1421,2019-05-29,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DeMARCUS COUSINS: Coming out and playing Warriors basketball.  Playing the right way.  Playing good defense on the screens, moving the ball, making it hard for the opponent to guard us and just playing our style of ball.  So if we do those things, we got a great chance","Player"
1422,2019-05-29,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DeMARCUS COUSINS: I believe this is the stage that every basketball player as a kid growing up dreams of.  To be here is a huge honor and it's an incredible feeling, so I'm extremely excited about it and it makes me that much more -- it makes me that much more antsy to get on the floor and help my team.  If that opportunity is presented to me, I plan on taking full advantage of it","Player"
1423,2019-05-29,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DeMARCUS COUSINS: It's been difficult, it's tough.  You work so hard at something, and then you think you've overcome that rough patch and then something else happens.  It's the nature of the beast.  I'm not the first and I won't be the last, but all I can do is control what I can control and put the effort in every day and better myself, my craft, my body, my skill, whatever the case may be, and like I said, if the opportunity's presented to me, just try to take full advantage of it, which I plan on doing","Player"
1424,2019-05-29,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DeMARCUS COUSINS: It's obvious it's always tough to play on the road.  If we come out and do our game plan and play the style of basketball that we know we can play, we'll take care of our business, we'll have a great chance","Player"
1425,2019-05-29,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DeMARCUS COUSINS: Well, Kawhi's a special player, so to say take him out, I mean that's a big task.  Like I said, he's a special player.  We'll have our schemes and we'll have our game plans and come out and try to contain everybody on the floor and figure out the best game plan to help us win the game.  So that being said, we'll figure something out and hopefully it goes in our favor","Player"
1426,2019-05-29,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DeMARCUS COUSINS: Just growing every day, asyoung players a lot is thrown at them early on and I think they handled it great.  Kevon has grown tremendously throughout this season.  I felt DJ was growing at a rapid pace before he went down with his injury, but they're special talents.  One thing about those young guys is they love to listen.  They're like sponges and any information you give them, they take it in.  So with that being said, it's easy to work with a young guy that's like that.","Player"
1427,2019-05-29,"DeMarcus Cousins ","Practice","N/A","DeMARCUS COUSINS: Like you said, fairness doesn't really play a part in this sport.  Fairness doesn't really play a part in life, honestly, but these are the cards I was dealt and all I can do is deal with it however it comes.  So I'll make the best of the situation, which I've tried to do.","Player"
1428,2019-05-29,"Andrew Bogut","Practice","N/A","ANDREW BOGUT: It was good.  The league's an up-and-coming league.  As we saw yesterday with one of the top high school prospects signing over there, and it's getting better.  The league's taken its hits over the last decade or so.  But a new ownership group has taken over the league, a new commissioner.  I feel like the league's starting to get some momentum in a positive direction.  Still work to do but it's been a really good 12 months for the league and hopefully it continues to grow","Player"
1429,2019-05-29,"Andrew Bogut","Practice","N/A","ANDREW BOGUT: Maybe a little bit.  Maybe a little bit.  They obviously just came out of a tough series. We finished ours off pretty early.  But once you get to this point, you can argue it either way, depending upon who wins Game 1 you can write a story saying it helped or hindered us.  So we're not too worried about it.  We definitely were a team that needed those rest days.  We have a lot of guys that were banged up at that point with Andre and obviously KD and DeMarcus.","Player"
1430,2019-05-29,"Andrew Bogut","Practice","N/A","ANDREW BOGUT: Their length first and foremost. Pretty much at all their positions they have length.  Kyle's not as long but is bulldog defensively.  He takes a lot of charges, he's physical, he's a high-basketball ","Player"
1431,2019-05-29,"Andrew Bogut","Practice","N/A","ANDREW BOGUT: Really important.  Unfortunately in today's kind of sporting landscape everyone looks at the stat sheet at the end of the game and judges players on what they have in the box score.  But when you watch a game and you know anything about basketball, those two guys are prime examples of people that affect the game in so many different ways that you can't really add it up on a stat sheet.  They're kind of the emotional leaders of their team, I think for both guys.  Kyle likes to get physical and take charges and get on the floor and chase loose balls, and Draymond is much of the same.  So we know that both of those guys are vital for either team to win","Player"
1432,2019-05-29,"Andrew Bogut","Practice","N/A","ANDREW BOGUT: Yeah, they're physical, they get on loose balls, they're happy to do the little things that win basketball games that might not show up on a stat sheet.  Like I said, Draymond for us, grabbing a rebound, being a wrecking ball and pushing the ball, he might not get an assist on the possession, but he opens up somebody else.  His ","Player"
1433,2019-05-29,"Andrew Bogut","Practice","N/A","ANDREW BOGUT: He's been great for us.  He had huge plays throughout that Houston and Portland series in vital moments of Game 6 and Game 4.  Great guy in the locker room, comes in, puts his work in, shooting the three ball at a clip, and he gets a lot of extra possessions for us as well.  He's a very good offensive rebounder, very athletic, very strong.  So it's great story. Looney, we have a lot of guys off our bench that continue to surprise people and aren't probably given enough credit because we have Steph, Klay, KD, Draymond, DeMarcus.  Our bench guys don't probably get as much attention, but I think that's kind of a reason why we're successful.","Player"
1434,2019-05-29,"Jordan Bell","Practice","N/A","JORDAN BELL: A little bit just because we're starting away for the first time, so you have more adversity to deal with than if you start at home.  It's easier to play at home with the fans being there.  We haven't won here this year, so it's definitely going to make it tougher","Player"
1435,2019-05-29,"Jordan Bell","Practice","N/A","JORDAN BELL: Well, I'm fine.  I'm not too high, I'm not too low.  I just want to play basketball.  We have been off for so long so I'm just anxious to play right now","Player"
1436,2019-05-29,"Jordan Bell","Practice","N/A","JORDAN BELL: No, we scrimmaged a lot more than we would during the regular season practices, just to make sure we have that feel, keep that conditioning up.  But it was tough because we couldn't go over personnel for awhile because we didn't know who we were playing.  So it would be kind of pointless to do personnel on both teams, but all practices are just kind of like maintenance practices, defensive things, just simple stuff, just to make sure we stay in good shape and stay ready","Player"
1437,2019-05-29,"Jordan Bell","Practice","N/A","JORDAN BELL: Obviously everybody's watching you, fans are going crazy, last year to start at home I know the fans were probably louder than they have ever been just because the Warriors, LeBron, so hopefully the same energy is here and we can try to feed off that too","Player"
1438,2019-05-29,"Jordan Bell","Practice","N/A","JORDAN BELL: I think they have been talking to us all year about that, I don't think it's something we just started playing for. Obviously everybody on our team knew we were going to be here this year.  That was our goal.  So the whole year was always getting ready for this moment, it wasn't trying to win like a whole bunch of games -- obviously you try to win every game -- but the goal was to win a championship.  So I think everybody's who is on the team expected us to be here","Player"
1439,2019-05-29,"Jordan Bell","Practice","N/A","JORDAN BELL: I think a little bit of both.  I think it helps us because we obviously need the rest.  The players are playing every other day, against the Blazers, that was something like I know we didn't experience at all in the playoffs yet.  So it was a good thing with that, but then momentum, like you want to keep playing.  You want to keep that same fire lit the whole time.  So we had nine days off, we kind of relaxed.  You have days off, so you want to enjoy the days off doing nothing or whatever you do, but I think it's a good and bad in both ways","Player"
1440,2019-05-29,"Jordan Bell","Practice","N/A","JORDAN BELL: I think that this team has experienced that like two years ago when they swept everybody in the first two rounds they had a long break too.  So I think the vets who were there before they've been  making sure we have been staying ready, we have been scrimmaging, some of the young guys we had our own little scrimmage just to make sure that we're ready for the NBA Finals","Player"
1441,2019-05-29,"Jordan Bell","Practice","N/A","JORDAN BELL: That's the big thing we've been talking about, we don't really know these guys.  We watched a lot of film but we never played against the team they have now and they haven't played against the team we are now.  So it's definitely a big difference.  So kind of makes it more interesting because there's a scouting report, but there's no feel for it.  Like you don't know people's tendencies as far as playing them and thing like that.  Like Marc Gasol isn't the same person he was in Memphis and there are a bunch of people like that and different roles that they have now.  I think it will be very interesting, like a pick-up game almost to say.","Player"
1442,2019-05-29,"OG Anunoby ","Practice","N/A","OG ANUNOBY: Attention to detail.  Attention to detail.  He's very serious, very locked in at all times.  He prepares really well.  He takes care of his body, stuff like that","Player"

1444,2019-05-29,"OG Anunoby ","Practice","N/A","OG ANUNOBY: Yeah, I think it's good.  He brings a bunch of energy.  He gets the fans into it, too","Player"
1445,2019-05-29,"OG Anunoby ","Practice","N/A","OG ANUNOBY: Yeah, like you can't like say like bad words.  I mean, I guess you can.  There's a point you can take it too far. I think most people know when it gets too far.","Player"
